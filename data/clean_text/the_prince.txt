chapter i how many kinds of principalities there are and by what means they are acquired all states all powers that have held and hold rule over men have been and are either republics or principalities principalities are either hereditary in which the family has been long established or they are new the new are either entirely new as was milan to francesco sforza or they are as it were members annexed to the hereditary state of the prince who has acquired them as was the kingdom of naples to that of the king of spain such dominions thus acquired are either accustomed to live under a prince or to live in freedom and are acquired either by the arms of the prince himself or of others or else by fortune or by ability chapter iiconcerning hereditary principalities i will leave out all discussion on republics inasmuch as in another place i have written of them at length and will address myself only to principalities in doing so i will keep to the order indicated above and discuss how such principalities are to be ruled and preserved i say at once there are fewer difficulties in holding hereditary states and those long accustomed to the family of their prince than new ones for it is sufficient only not to transgress the customs of his ancestors and to deal prudently with circumstances as they arise for a prince of average powers to maintain himself in his state unless he be deprived of it by some extraordinary and excessive force and if he should be so deprived of it whenever anything sinister happens to the usurper he will regain it we have in italy for example the duke of ferrara who could not have withstood the attacks of the venetians in  nor those of pope julius in  unless he had been long established in his dominions for the hereditary prince has less cause and less necessity to offend hence it happens that he will be more loved and unless extraordinary vices cause him to be hated it is reasonable to expect that his subjects will be naturally well disposed towards him and in the antiquity and duration of his rule the memories and motives that make for change are lost for one change always leaves the toothing for another chapter iii concerning mixed principalities but the difficulties occur in a new principality and firstly if it be not entirely new but is as it were a member of a state which taken collectively may be called composite the changes arise chiefly from an inherent difficulty which there is in all new principalities for men change their rulers willingly hoping to better themselves and this hope induces them to take up arms against him who rules wherein they are deceived because they afterwards find by experience they have gone from bad to worse this follows also on another natural and common necessity which always causes a new prince to burden those who have submitted to him with his soldiery and with infinite other hardships which he must put upon his new acquisition in this way you have enemies in all those whom you have injured in seizing that principality and you are not able to keep those friends who put you there because of your not being able to satisfy them in the way they expected and you cannot take strong measures against them feeling bound to them for although one may be very strong in armed forces yet in entering a province one has always need of the goodwill of the natives for these reasons louis the twelfth king of france quickly occupied milan and as quickly lost it and to turn him out the first time it only needed lodovicos own forces because those who had opened the gates to him finding themselves deceived in their hopes of future benefit would not endure the illtreatment of the new prince it is very true that after acquiring rebellious provinces a second time they are not so lightly lost afterwards because the prince with little reluctance takes the opportunity of the rebellion to punish the delinquents to clear out the suspects and to strengthen himself in the weakest places thus to cause france to lose milan the first time it was enough for the duke lodovico to raise insurrections on the borders but to cause him to lose it a second time it was necessary to bring the whole world against him and that his armies should be defeated and driven out of italy which followed from the causes above mentioned nevertheless milan was taken from france both the first and the second time the general reasons for the first have been discussed it remains to name those for the second and to see what resources he had and what any one in his situation would have had for maintaining himself more securely in his acquisition than did the king of france now i say that those dominions which when acquired are added to an ancient state by him who acquires them are either of the same country and language or they are not when they are it is easier to hold them especially when they have not been accustomed to selfgovernment and to hold them securely it is enough to have destroyed the family of the prince who was ruling them because the two peoples preserving in other things the old conditions and not being unlike in customs will live quietly together as one has seen in brittany burgundy gascony and normandy which have been bound to france for so long a time and although there may be some difference in language nevertheless the customs are alike and the people will easily be able to get on amongst themselves he who has annexed them if he wishes to hold them has only to bear in mind two considerations the one that the family of their former lord is extinguished the other that neither their laws nor their taxes are altered so that in a very short time they will become entirely one body with the old principality but when states are acquired in a country differing in language customs or laws there are difficulties and good fortune and great energy are needed to hold them and one of the greatest and most real helps would be that he who has acquired them should go and reside there this would make his position more secure and durable as it has made that of the turk in greece who notwithstanding all the other measures taken by him for holding that state if he had not settled there would not have been able to keep it because if one is on the spot disorders are seen as they spring up and one can quickly remedy them but if one is not at hand they are heard of only when they are great and then one can no longer remedy them besides this the country is not pillaged by your officials the subjects are satisfied by prompt recourse to the prince thus wishing to be good they have more cause to love him and wishing to be otherwise to fear him he who would attack that state from the outside must have the utmost caution as long as the prince resides there it can only be wrested from him with the greatest difficulty the other and better course is to send colonies to one or two places which may be as keys to that state for it is necessary either to do this or else to keep there a great number of cavalry and infantry a prince does not spend much on colonies for with little or no expense he can send them out and keep them there and he offends a minority only of the citizens from whom he takes lands and houses to give them to the new inhabitants and those whom he offends remaining poor and scattered are never able to injure him whilst the rest being uninjured are easily kept quiet and at the same time are anxious not to err for fear it should happen to them as it has to those who have been despoiled in conclusion i say that these colonies are not costly they are more faithful they injure less and the injured as has been said being poor and scattered cannot hurt upon this one has to remark that men ought either to be well treated or crushed because they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries of more serious ones they cannot therefore the injury that is to be done to a man ought to be of such a kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge but in maintaining armed men there in place of colonies one spends much more having to consume on the garrison all the income from the state so that the acquisition turns into a loss and many more are exasperated because the whole state is injured through the shifting of the garrison up and down all become acquainted with hardship and all become hostile and they are enemies who whilst beaten on their own ground are yet able to do hurt for every reason therefore such guards are as useless as a colony is useful again the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects ought to make himself the head and defender of his less powerful neighbours and to weaken the more powerful amongst them taking care that no foreigner as powerful as himself shall by any accident get a footing there for it will always happen that such a one will be introduced by those who are discontented either through excess of ambition or through fear as one has seen already the romans were brought into greece by the tolians and in every other country where they obtained a footing they were brought in by the inhabitants and the usual course of affairs is that as soon as a powerful foreigner enters a country all the subject states are drawn to him moved by the hatred which they feel against the ruling power so that in respect to those subject states he has not to take any trouble to gain them over to himself for the whole of them quickly rally to the state which he has acquired there he has only to take care that they do not get hold of too much power and too much authority and then with his own forces and with their goodwill he can easily keep down the more powerful of them so as to remain entirely master in the country and he who does not properly manage this business will soon lose what he has acquired and whilst he does hold it he will have endless difficulties and troubles the romans in the countries which they annexed observed closely these measures they sent colonies and maintained friendly relations with the minor powers without increasing their strength they kept down the greater and did not allow any strong foreign powers to gain authority greece appears to me sufficient for an example the achaeans and tolians were kept friendly by them the kingdom of macedonia was humbled antiochus was driven out yet the merits of the achaeans and tolians never secured for them permission to increase their power nor did the persuasions of philip ever induce the romans to be his friends without first humbling him nor did the influence of antiochus make them agree that he should retain any lordship over the country because the romans did in these instances what all prudent princes ought to do who have to regard not only present troubles but also future ones for which they must prepare with every energy because when foreseen it is easy to remedy them but if you wait until they approach the medicine is no longer in time because the malady has become incurable for it happens in this as the physicians say it happens in hectic fever that in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but difficult to detect but in the course of time not having been either detected or treated in the beginning it becomes easy to detect but difficult to cure thus it happens in affairs of state for when the evils that arise have been foreseen which it is only given to a wise man to see they can be quickly redressed but when through not having been foreseen they have been permitted to grow in a way that every one can see them there is no longer a remedy therefore the romans foreseeing troubles dealt with them at once and even to avoid a war would not let them come to a head for they knew that war is not to be avoided but is only to be put off to the advantage of others moreover they wished to fight with philip and antiochus in greece so as not to have to do it in italy they could have avoided both but this they did not wish nor did that ever please them which is forever in the mouths of the wise ones of our timelet us enjoy the benefits of the timebut rather the benefits of their own valour and prudence for time drives everything before it and is able to bring with it good as well as evil and evil as well as good but let us turn to france and inquire whether she has done any of the things mentioned i will speak of louis and not of charles as the one whose conduct is the better to be observed he having held possession of italy for the longest period and you will see that he has done the opposite to those things which ought to be done to retain a state composed of divers elements king louis was brought into italy by the ambition of the venetians who desired to obtain half the state of lombardy by his intervention i will not blame the course taken by the king because wishing to get a foothold in italy and having no friends thereseeing rather that every door was shut to him owing to the conduct of charleshe was forced to accept those friendships which he could get and he would have succeeded very quickly in his design if in other matters he had not made some mistakes the king however having acquired lombardy regained at once the authority which charles had lost genoa yielded the florentines became his friends the marquess of mantua the duke of ferrara the bentivogli my lady of forli the lords of faenza of pesaro of rimini of camerino of piombino the lucchese the pisans the sieneseeverybody made advances to him to become his friend then could the venetians realize the rashness of the course taken by them which in order that they might secure two towns in lombardy had made the king master of twothirds of italy let any one now consider with what little difficulty the king could have maintained his position in italy had he observed the rules above laid down and kept all his friends secure and protected for although they were numerous they were both weak and timid some afraid of the church some of the venetians and thus they would always have been forced to stand in with him and by their means he could easily have made himself secure against those who remained powerful but he was no sooner in milan than he did the contrary by assisting pope alexander to occupy the romagna it never occurred to him that by this action he was weakening himself depriving himself of friends and of those who had thrown themselves into his lap whilst he aggrandized the church by adding much temporal power to the spiritual thus giving it greater authority and having committed this prime error he was obliged to follow it up so much so that to put an end to the ambition of alexander and to prevent his becoming the master of tuscany he was himself forced to come into italy and as if it were not enough to have aggrandized the church and deprived himself of friends he wishing to have the kingdom of naples divided it with the king of spain and where he was the prime arbiter in italy he takes an associate so that the ambitious of that country and the malcontents of his own should have somewhere to shelter and whereas he could have left in the kingdom his own pensioner as king he drove him out to put one there who was able to drive him louis out in turn the wish to acquire is in truth very natural and common and men always do so when they can and for this they will be praised not blamed but when they cannot do so yet wish to do so by any means then there is folly and blame therefore if france could have attacked naples with her own forces she ought to have done so if she could not then she ought not to have divided it and if the partition which she made with the venetians in lombardy was justified by the excuse that by it she got a foothold in italy this other partition merited blame for it had not the excuse of that necessity therefore louis made these five errors he destroyed the minor powers he increased the strength of one of the greater powers in italy he brought in a foreign power he did not settle in the country he did not send colonies which errors had he lived were not enough to injure him had he not made a sixth by taking away their dominions from the venetians because had he not aggrandized the church nor brought spain into italy it would have been very reasonable and necessary to humble them but having first taken these steps he ought never to have consented to their ruin for they being powerful would always have kept off others from designs on lombardy to which the venetians would never have consented except to become masters themselves there also because the others would not wish to take lombardy from france in order to give it to the venetians and to run counter to both they would not have had the courage and if any one should say king louis yielded the romagna to alexander and the kingdom to spain to avoid war i answer for the reasons given above that a blunder ought never to be perpetrated to avoid war because it is not to be avoided but is only deferred to your disadvantage and if another should allege the pledge which the king had given to the pope that he would assist him in the enterprise in exchange for the dissolution of his marriage and for the cap to rouen to that i reply what i shall write later on concerning the faith of princes and how it ought to be kept thus king louis lost lombardy by not having followed any of the conditions observed by those who have taken possession of countries and wished to retain them nor is there any miracle in this but much that is reasonable and quite natural and on these matters i spoke at nantes with rouen when valentino as cesare borgia the son of pope alexander was usually called occupied the romagna and on cardinal rouen observing to me that the italians did not understand war i replied to him that the french did not understand statecraft meaning that otherwise they would not have allowed the church to reach such greatness and in fact it has been seen that the greatness of the church and of spain in italy has been caused by france and her ruin may be attributed to them from this a general rule is drawn which never or rarely fails that he who is the cause of another becoming powerful is ruined because that predominancy has been brought about either by astuteness or else by force and both are distrusted by him who has been raised to power chapter iv why the kingdom of darius conquered by alexander did not rebel against the successors of alexander at his death considering the difficulties which men have had to hold to a newly acquired state some might wonder how seeing that alexander the great became the master of asia in a few years and died whilst it was scarcely settled whence it might appear reasonable that the whole empire would have rebelled nevertheless his successors maintained themselves and had to meet no other difficulty than that which arose among themselves from their own ambitions i answer that the principalities of which one has record are found to be governed in two different ways either by a prince with a body of servants who assist him to govern the kingdom as ministers by his favour and permission or by a prince and barons who hold that dignity by antiquity of blood and not by the grace of the prince such barons have states and their own subjects who recognize them as lords and hold them in natural affection those states that are governed by a prince and his servants hold their prince in more consideration because in all the country there is no one who is recognized as superior to him and if they yield obedience to another they do it as to a minister and official and they do not bear him any particular affection the examples of these two governments in our time are the turk and the king of france the entire monarchy of the turk is governed by one lord the others are his servants and dividing his kingdom into sanjaks he sends there different administrators and shifts and changes them as he chooses but the king of france is placed in the midst of an ancient body of lords acknowledged by their own subjects and beloved by them they have their own prerogatives nor can the king take these away except at his peril therefore he who considers both of these states will recognize great difficulties in seizing the state of the turk but once it is conquered great ease in holding it the causes of the difficulties in seizing the kingdom of the turk are that the usurper cannot be called in by the princes of the kingdom nor can he hope to be assisted in his designs by the revolt of those whom the lord has around him this arises from the reasons given above for his ministers being all slaves and bondmen can only be corrupted with great difficulty and one can expect little advantage from them when they have been corrupted as they cannot carry the people with them for the reasons assigned hence he who attacks the turk must bear in mind that he will find him united and he will have to rely more on his own strength than on the revolt of others but if once the turk has been conquered and routed in the field in such a way that he cannot replace his armies there is nothing to fear but the family of this prince and this being exterminated there remains no one to fear the others having no credit with the people and as the conqueror did not rely on them before his victory so he ought not to fear them after it the contrary happens in kingdoms governed like that of france because one can easily enter there by gaining over some baron of the kingdom for one always finds malcontents and such as desire a change such men for the reasons given can open the way into the state and render the victory easy but if you wish to hold it afterwards you meet with infinite difficulties both from those who have assisted you and from those you have crushed nor is it enough for you to have exterminated the family of the prince because the lords that remain make themselves the heads of fresh movements against you and as you are unable either to satisfy or exterminate them that state is lost whenever time brings the opportunity now if you will consider what was the nature of the government of darius you will find it similar to the kingdom of the turk and therefore it was only necessary for alexander first to overthrow him in the field and then to take the country from him after which victory darius being killed the state remained secure to alexander for the above reasons and if his successors had been united they would have enjoyed it securely and at their ease for there were no tumults raised in the kingdom except those they provoked themselves but it is impossible to hold with such tranquillity states constituted like that of france hence arose those frequent rebellions against the romans in spain france and greece owing to the many principalities there were in these states of which as long as the memory of them endured the romans always held an insecure possession but with the power and long continuance of the empire the memory of them passed away and the romans then became secure possessors and when fighting afterwards amongst themselves each one was able to attach to himself his own parts of the country according to the authority he had assumed there and the family of the former lord being exterminated none other than the romans were acknowledged when these things are remembered no one will marvel at the ease with which alexander held the empire of asia or at the difficulties which others have had to keep an acquisition such as pyrrhus and many more this is not occasioned by the little or abundance of ability in the conqueror but by the want of uniformity in the subject state chapter v concerning the way to govern cities or principalities which lived under their own laws before they were annexed whenever those states which have been acquired as stated have been accustomed to live under their own laws and in freedom there are three courses for those who wish to hold them the first is to ruin them the next is to reside there in person the third is to permit them to live under their own laws drawing a tribute and establishing within it an oligarchy which will keep it friendly to you because such a government being created by the prince knows that it cannot stand without his friendship and interest and does its utmost to support him and therefore he who would keep a city accustomed to freedom will hold it more easily by the means of its own citizens than in any other way there are for example the spartans and the romans the spartans held athens and thebes establishing there an oligarchy nevertheless they lost them the romans in order to hold capua carthage and numantia dismantled them and did not lose them they wished to hold greece as the spartans held it making it free and permitting its laws and did not succeed so to hold it they were compelled to dismantle many cities in the country for in truth there is no safe way to retain them otherwise than by ruining them and he who becomes master of a city accustomed to freedom and does not destroy it may expect to be destroyed by it for in rebellion it has always the watchword of liberty and its ancient privileges as a rallying point which neither time nor benefits will ever cause it to forget and whatever you may do or provide against they never forget that name or their privileges unless they are disunited or dispersed but at every chance they immediately rally to them as pisa after the hundred years she had been held in bondage by the florentines but when cities or countries are accustomed to live under a prince and his family is exterminated they being on the one hand accustomed to obey and on the other hand not having the old prince cannot agree in making one from amongst themselves and they do not know how to govern themselves for this reason they are very slow to take up arms and a prince can gain them to himself and secure them much more easily but in republics there is more vitality greater hatred and more desire for vengeance which will never permit them to allow the memory of their former liberty to rest so that the safest way is to destroy them or to reside there chapter vi concerning new principalities which are acquired by ones own arms and ability let no one be surprised if in speaking of entirely new principalities as i shall do i adduce the highest examples both of prince and of state because men walking almost always in paths beaten by others and following by imitation their deeds are yet unable to keep entirely to the ways of others or attain to the power of those they imitate a wise man ought always to follow the paths beaten by great men and to imitate those who have been supreme so that if his ability does not equal theirs at least it will savour of it let him act like the clever archers who designing to hit the mark which yet appears too far distant and knowing the limits to which the strength of their bow attains take aim much higher than the mark not to reach by their strength or arrow to so great a height but to be able with the aid of so high an aim to hit the mark they wish to reach i say therefore that in entirely new principalities where there is a new prince more or less difficulty is found in keeping them accordingly as there is more or less ability in him who has acquired the state now as the fact of becoming a prince from a private station presupposes either ability or fortune it is clear that one or other of these things will mitigate in some degree many difficulties nevertheless he who has relied least on fortune is established the strongest further it facilitates matters when the prince having no other state is compelled to reside there in person but to come to those who by their own ability and not through fortune have risen to be princes i say that moses cyrus romulus theseus and such like are the most excellent examples and although one may not discuss moses he having been a mere executor of the will of god yet he ought to be admired if only for that favour which made him worthy to speak with god but in considering cyrus and others who have acquired or founded kingdoms all will be found admirable and if their particular deeds and conduct shall be considered they will not be found inferior to those of moses although he had so great a preceptor and in examining their actions and lives one cannot see that they owed anything to fortune beyond opportunity which brought them the material to mould into the form which seemed best to them without that opportunity their powers of mind would have been extinguished and without those powers the opportunity would have come in vain it was necessary therefore to moses that he should find the people of israel in egypt enslaved and oppressed by the egyptians in order that they should be disposed to follow him so as to be delivered out of bondage it was necessary that romulus should not remain in alba and that he should be abandoned at his birth in order that he should become king of rome and founder of the fatherland it was necessary that cyrus should find the persians discontented with the government of the medes and the medes soft and effeminate through their long peace theseus could not have shown his ability had he not found the athenians dispersed these opportunities therefore made those men fortunate and their high ability enabled them to recognize the opportunity whereby their country was ennobled and made famous those who by valorous ways become princes like these men acquire a principality with difficulty but they keep it with ease the difficulties they have in acquiring it rise in part from the new rules and methods which they are forced to introduce to establish their government and its security and it ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand more perilous to conduct or more uncertain in its success than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new this coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents who have the laws on their side and partly from the incredulity of men who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them thus it happens that whenever those who are hostile have the opportunity to attack they do it like partisans whilst the others defend lukewarmly in such wise that the prince is endangered along with them it is necessary therefore if we desire to discuss this matter thoroughly to inquire whether these innovators can rely on themselves or have to depend on others that is to say whether to consummate their enterprise have they to use prayers or can they use force in the first instance they always succeed badly and never compass anything but when they can rely on themselves and use force then they are rarely endangered hence it is that all armed prophets have conquered and the unarmed ones have been destroyed besides the reasons mentioned the nature of the people is variable and whilst it is easy to persuade them it is difficult to fix them in that persuasion and thus it is necessary to take such measures that when they believe no longer it may be possible to make them believe by force if moses cyrus theseus and romulus had been unarmed they could not have enforced their constitutions for longas happened in our time to fra girolamo savonarola who was ruined with his new order of things immediately the multitude believed in him no longer and he had no means of keeping steadfast those who believed or of making the unbelievers to believe therefore such as these have great difficulties in consummating their enterprise for all their dangers are in the ascent yet with ability they will overcome them but when these are overcome and those who envied them their success are exterminated they will begin to be respected and they will continue afterwards powerful secure honoured and happy to these great examples i wish to add a lesser one still it bears some resemblance to them and i wish it to suffice me for all of a like kind it is hiero the syracusanthis man rose from a private station to be prince of syracuse nor did he either owe anything to fortune but opportunity for the syracusans being oppressed chose him for their captain afterwards he was rewarded by being made their prince he was of so great ability even as a private citizen that one who writes of him says he wanted nothing but a kingdom to be a king this man abolished the old soldiery organized the new gave up old alliances made new ones and as he had his own soldiers and allies on such foundations he was able to build any edifice thus whilst he had endured much trouble in acquiring he had but little in keeping chapter vii concerning new principalities which are acquired either by the arms of others or by good fortune those who solely by good fortune become princes from being private citizens have little trouble in rising but much in keeping atop they have not any difficulties on the way up because they fly but they have many when they reach the summit such are those to whom some state is given either for money or by the favour of him who bestows it as happened to many in greece in the cities of ionia and of the hellespont where princes were made by darius in order that they might hold the cities both for his security and his glory as also were those emperors who by the corruption of the soldiers from being citizens came to empire such a stand simply elevated upon the goodwill and the fortune of him who has elevated themtwo most inconstant and unstable things neither have they the knowledge requisite for the position because unless they are men of great worth and ability it is not reasonable to expect that they should know how to command having always lived in a private condition besides they cannot hold it because they have not forces which they can keep friendly and faithful states that rise unexpectedly then like all other things in nature which are born and grow rapidly cannot leave their foundations and correspondencies fixed in such a way that the first storm will not overthrow them unless as is said those who unexpectedly become princes are men of so much ability that they know they have to be prepared at once to hold that which fortune has thrown into their laps and that those foundations which others have laid before they became princes they must lay afterwards concerning these two methods of rising to be a prince by ability or fortune i wish to adduce two examples within our own recollection and these are francesco sforza and cesare borgia francesco by proper means and with great ability from being a private person rose to be duke of milan and that which he had acquired with a thousand anxieties he kept with little trouble on the other hand cesare borgia called by the people duke valentino acquired his state during the ascendancy of his father and on its decline he lost it notwithstanding that he had taken every measure and done all that ought to be done by a wise and able man to fix firmly his roots in the states which the arms and fortunes of others had bestowed on him because as is stated above he who has not first laid his foundations may be able with great ability to lay them afterwards but they will be laid with trouble to the architect and danger to the building if therefore all the steps taken by the duke be considered it will be seen that he laid solid foundations for his future power and i do not consider it superfluous to discuss them because i do not know what better precepts to give a new prince than the example of his actions and if his dispositions were of no avail that was not his fault but the extraordinary and extreme malignity of fortune alexander the sixth in wishing to aggrandize the duke his son had many immediate and prospective difficulties firstly he did not see his way to make him master of any state that was not a state of the church and if he was willing to rob the church he knew that the duke of milan and the venetians would not consent because faenza and rimini were already under the protection of the venetians besides this he saw the arms of italy especially those by which he might have been assisted in hands that would fear the aggrandizement of the pope namely the orsini and the colonnesi and their following it behoved him therefore to upset this state of affairs and embroil the powers so as to make himself securely master of part of their states this was easy for him to do because he found the venetians moved by other reasons inclined to bring back the french into italy he would not only not oppose this but he would render it more easy by dissolving the former marriage of king louis therefore the king came into italy with the assistance of the venetians and the consent of alexander he was no sooner in milan than the pope had soldiers from him for the attempt on the romagna which yielded to him on the reputation of the king the duke therefore having acquired the romagna and beaten the colonnesi while wishing to hold that and to advance further was hindered by two things the one his forces did not appear loyal to him the other the goodwill of france that is to say he feared that the forces of the orsini which he was using would not stand to him that not only might they hinder him from winning more but might themselves seize what he had won and that the king might also do the same of the orsini he had a warning when after taking faenza and attacking bologna he saw them go very unwillingly to that attack and as to the king he learned his mind when he himself after taking the duchy of urbino attacked tuscany and the king made him desist from that undertaking hence the duke decided to depend no more upon the arms and the luck of others for the first thing he weakened the orsini and colonnesi parties in rome by gaining to himself all their adherents who were gentlemen making them his gentlemen giving them good pay and according to their rank honouring them with office and command in such a way that in a few months all attachment to the factions was destroyed and turned entirely to the duke after this he awaited an opportunity to crush the orsini having scattered the adherents of the colonna house this came to him soon and he used it well for the orsini perceiving at length that the aggrandizement of the duke and the church was ruin to them called a meeting of the magione in perugia from this sprung the rebellion at urbino and the tumults in the romagna with endless dangers to the duke all of which he overcame with the help of the french having restored his authority not to leave it at risk by trusting either to the french or other outside forces he had recourse to his wiles and he knew so well how to conceal his mind that by the mediation of signor pagolowhom the duke did not fail to secure with all kinds of attention giving him money apparel and horsesthe orsini were reconciled so that their simplicity brought them into his power at sinigalia having exterminated the leaders and turned their partisans into his friends the duke laid sufficiently good foundations to his power having all the romagna and the duchy of urbino and the people now beginning to appreciate their prosperity he gained them all over to himself and as this point is worthy of notice and to be imitated by others i am not willing to leave it out when the duke occupied the romagna he found it under the rule of weak masters who rather plundered their subjects than ruled them and gave them more cause for disunion than for union so that the country was full of robbery quarrels and every kind of violence and so wishing to bring back peace and obedience to authority he considered it necessary to give it a good governor thereupon he promoted messer ramiro dorco a swift and cruel man to whom he gave the fullest power this man in a short time restored peace and unity with the greatest success afterwards the duke considered that it was not advisable to confer such excessive authority for he had no doubt but that he would become odious so he set up a court of judgment in the country under a most excellent president wherein all cities had their advocates and because he knew that the past severity had caused some hatred against himself so to clear himself in the minds of the people and gain them entirely to himself he desired to show that if any cruelty had been practised it had not originated with him but in the natural sternness of the minister under this pretence he took ramiro and one morning caused him to be executed and left on the piazza at cesena with the block and a bloody knife at his side the barbarity of this spectacle caused the people to be at once satisfied and dismayed but let us return whence we started i say that the duke finding himself now sufficiently powerful and partly secured from immediate dangers by having armed himself in his own way and having in a great measure crushed those forces in his vicinity that could injure him if he wished to proceed with his conquest had next to consider france for he knew that the king who too late was aware of his mistake would not support him and from this time he began to seek new alliances and to temporize with france in the expedition which she was making towards the kingdom of naples against the spaniards who were besieging gaeta it was his intention to secure himself against them and this he would have quickly accomplished had alexander lived such was his line of action as to present affairs but as to the future he had to fear in the first place that a new successor to the church might not be friendly to him and might seek to take from him that which alexander had given him so he decided to act in four ways firstly by exterminating the families of those lords whom he had despoiled so as to take away that pretext from the pope secondly by winning to himself all the gentlemen of rome so as to be able to curb the pope with their aid as has been observed thirdly by converting the college more to himself fourthly by acquiring so much power before the pope should die that he could by his own measures resist the first shock of these four things at the death of alexander he had accomplished three for he had killed as many of the dispossessed lords as he could lay hands on and few had escaped he had won over the roman gentlemen and he had the most numerous party in the college and as to any fresh acquisition he intended to become master of tuscany for he already possessed perugia and piombino and pisa was under his protection and as he had no longer to study france for the french were already driven out of the kingdom of naples by the spaniards and in this way both were compelled to buy his goodwill he pounced down upon pisa after this lucca and siena yielded at once partly through hatred and partly through fear of the florentines and the florentines would have had no remedy had he continued to prosper as he was prospering the year that alexander died for he had acquired so much power and reputation that he would have stood by himself and no longer have depended on the luck and the forces of others but solely on his own power and ability but alexander died five years after he had first drawn the sword he left the duke with the state of romagna alone consolidated with the rest in the air between two most powerful hostile armies and sick unto death yet there were in the duke such boldness and ability and he knew so well how men are to be won or lost and so firm were the foundations which in so short a time he had laid that if he had not had those armies on his back or if he had been in good health he would have overcome all difficulties and it is seen that his foundations were good for the romagna awaited him for more than a month in rome although but half alive he remained secure and whilst the baglioni the vitelli and the orsini might come to rome they could not effect anything against him if he could not have made the pope whom he wished at least the one whom he did not wish would not have been elected but if he had been in sound health at the death of alexander everything would have been different to him on the day that julius the second was elected he told me that he had thought of everything that might occur at the death of his father and had provided a remedy for all except that he had never anticipated that when the death did happen he himself would be on the point to die when all the actions of the duke are recalled i do not know how to blame him but rather it appears to be as i have said that i ought to offer him for imitation to all those who by the fortune or the arms of others are raised to government because he having a lofty spirit and farreaching aims could not have regulated his conduct otherwise and only the shortness of the life of alexander and his own sickness frustrated his designs therefore he who considers it necessary to secure himself in his new principality to win friends to overcome either by force or fraud to make himself beloved and feared by the people to be followed and revered by the soldiers to exterminate those who have power or reason to hurt him to change the old order of things for new to be severe and gracious magnanimous and liberal to destroy a disloyal soldiery and to create new to maintain friendship with kings and princes in such a way that they must help him with zeal and offend with caution cannot find a more lively example than the actions of this man only can he be blamed for the election of julius the second in whom he made a bad choice because as is said not being able to elect a pope to his own mind he could have hindered any other from being elected pope and he ought never to have consented to the election of any cardinal whom he had injured or who had cause to fear him if they became pontiffs for men injure either from fear or hatred those whom he had injured amongst others were san pietro ad vincula colonna san giorgio and ascanio the rest in becoming pope had to fear him rouen and the spaniards excepted the latter from their relationship and obligations the former from his influence the kingdom of france having relations with him therefore above everything the duke ought to have created a spaniard pope and failing him he ought to have consented to rouen and not san pietro ad vincula he who believes that new benefits will cause great personages to forget old injuries is deceived therefore the duke erred in his choice and it was the cause of his ultimate ruin chapter viii concerning those who have obtained a principality by wickedness although a prince may rise from a private station in two ways neither of which can be entirely attributed to fortune or genius yet it is manifest to me that i must not be silent on them although one could be more copiously treated when i discuss republics these methods are when either by some wicked or nefarious ways one ascends to the principality or when by the favour of his fellowcitizens a private person becomes the prince of his country and speaking of the first method it will be illustrated by two examplesone ancient the other modernand without entering further into the subject i consider these two examples will suffice those who may be compelled to follow them agathocles the sicilian became king of syracuse not only from a private but from a low and abject position this man the son of a potter through all the changes in his fortunes always led an infamous life nevertheless he accompanied his infamies with so much ability of mind and body that having devoted himself to the military profession he rose through its ranks to be praetor of syracuse being established in that position and having deliberately resolved to make himself prince and to seize by violence without obligation to others that which had been conceded to him by assent he came to an understanding for this purpose with amilcar the carthaginian who with his army was fighting in sicily one morning he assembled the people and the senate of syracuse as if he had to discuss with them things relating to the republic and at a given signal the soldiers killed all the senators and the richest of the people these dead he seized and held the princedom of that city without any civil commotion and although he was twice routed by the carthaginians and ultimately besieged yet not only was he able to defend his city but leaving part of his men for its defence with the others he attacked africa and in a short time raised the siege of syracuse the carthaginians reduced to extreme necessity were compelled to come to terms with agathocles and leaving sicily to him had to be content with the possession of africatherefore he who considers the actions and the genius of this man will see nothing or little which can be attributed to fortune inasmuch as he attained preeminence as is shown above not by the favour of any one but step by step in the military profession which steps were gained with a thousand troubles and perils and were afterwards boldly held by him with many hazardous dangers yet it cannot be called talent to slay fellowcitizens to deceive friends to be without faith without mercy without religion such methods may gain empire but not glory still if the courage of agathocles in entering into and extricating himself from dangers be considered together with his greatness of mind in enduring and overcoming hardships it cannot be seen why he should be esteemed less than the most notable captain nevertheless his barbarous cruelty and inhumanity with infinite wickedness do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellent men what he achieved cannot be attributed either to fortune or genius in our times during the rule of alexander the sixth oliverotto da fermo having been left an orphan many years before was brought up by his maternal uncle giovanni fogliani and in the early days of his youth sent to fight under pagolo vitelli that being trained under his discipline he might attain some high position in the military profession after pagolo died he fought under his brother vitellozzo and in a very short time being endowed with wit and a vigorous body and mind he became the first man in his profession but it appearing a paltry thing to serve under others he resolved with the aid of some citizens of fermo to whom the slavery of their country was dearer than its liberty and with the help of the vitelleschi to seize fermo so he wrote to giovanni fogliani that having been away from home for many years he wished to visit him and his city and in some measure to look upon his patrimony and although he had not laboured to acquire anything except honour yet in order that the citizens should see he had not spent his time in vain he desired to come honourably so would be accompanied by one hundred horsemen his friends and retainers and he entreated giovanni to arrange that he should be received honourably by the fermians all of which would be not only to his honour but also to that of giovanni himself who had brought him up giovanni therefore did not fail in any attentions due to his nephew and he caused him to be honourably received by the fermians and he lodged him in his own house where having passed some days and having arranged what was necessary for his wicked designs oliverotto gave a solemn banquet to which he invited giovanni fogliani and the chiefs of fermo when the viands and all the other entertainments that are usual in such banquets were finished oliverotto artfully began certain grave discourses speaking of the greatness of pope alexander and his son cesare and of their enterprises to which discourse giovanni and others answered but he rose at once saying that such matters ought to be discussed in a more private place and he betook himself to a chamber whither giovanni and the rest of the citizens went in after him no sooner were they seated than soldiers issued from secret places and slaughtered giovanni and the rest after these murders oliverotto mounted on horseback rode up and down the town and besieged the chief magistrate in the palace so that in fear the people were forced to obey him and to form a government of which he made himself the prince he killed all the malcontents who were able to injure him and strengthened himself with new civil and military ordinances in such a way that in the year during which he held the principality not only was he secure in the city of fermo but he had become formidable to all his neighbours and his destruction would have been as difficult as that of agathocles if he had not allowed himself to be overreached by cesare borgia who took him with the orsini and vitelli at sinigalia as was stated above thus one year after he had committed this parricide he was strangled together with vitellozzo whom he had made his leader in valour and wickedness some may wonder how it can happen that agathocles and his like after infinite treacheries and cruelties should live for long secure in his country and defend himself from external enemies and never be conspired against by his own citizens seeing that many others by means of cruelty have never been able even in peaceful times to hold the state still less in the doubtful times of war i believe that this follows from severities being badly or properly used those may be called properly used if of evil it is possible to speak well that are applied at one blow and are necessary to ones security and that are not persisted in afterwards unless they can be turned to the advantage of the subjects the badly employed are those which notwithstanding they may be few in the commencement multiply with time rather than decrease those who practise the first system are able by aid of god or man to mitigate in some degree their rule as agathocles did it is impossible for those who follow the other to maintain themselves hence it is to be remarked that in seizing a state the usurper ought to examine closely into all those injuries which it is necessary for him to inflict and to do them all at one stroke so as not to have to repeat them daily and thus by not unsettling men he will be able to reassure them and win them to himself by benefits he who does otherwise either from timidity or evil advice is always compelled to keep the knife in his hand neither can he rely on his subjects nor can they attach themselves to him owing to their continued and repeated wrongs for injuries ought to be done all at one time so that being tasted less they offend less benefits ought to be given little by little so that the flavour of them may last longer and above all things a prince ought to live amongst his people in such a way that no unexpected circumstances whether of good or evil shall make him change because if the necessity for this comes in troubled times you are too late for harsh measures and mild ones will not help you for they will be considered as forced from you and no one will be under any obligation to you for them
