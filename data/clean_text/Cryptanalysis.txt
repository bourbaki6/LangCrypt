cryptanalysis from the greek kryptos hidden and analyein to analyze refers to the process of analyzing information systems in order to understand hidden aspects of the systems cryptanalysis is used to breach cryptographic security systems and gain access to the contents of encrypted messages even if the cryptographic key is unknown in addition to mathematical analysis of cryptographic algorithms cryptanalysis includes the study of sidechannel attacks that do not target weaknesses in the cryptographic algorithms themselves but instead exploit weaknesses in their implementation even though the goal has been the same the methods and techniques of cryptanalysis have changed drastically through the history of cryptography adapting to increasing cryptographic complexity ranging from the penandpaper methods of the past through machines like the british bombes and colossus computers at bletchley park in world war ii to the mathematically advanced computerized schemes of the present methods for breaking modern cryptosystems often involve solving carefully constructed problems in pure mathematics the bestknown being integer factorization overview in encryption confidential information called the plaintext is sent securely to a recipient by the sender first converting it into an unreadable form ciphertext using an encryption algorithm the ciphertext is sent through an insecure channel to the recipient the recipient decrypts the ciphertext by applying an inverse decryption algorithm recovering the plaintext to decrypt the ciphertext the recipient requires a secret knowledge from the sender usually a string of letters numbers or bits called a cryptographic key the concept is that even if an unauthorized person gets access to the ciphertext during transmission without the secret key they cannot convert it back to plaintext encryption has been used throughout history to send important military diplomatic and commercial messages and today is very widely used in computer networking to protect email and internet communication the goal of cryptanalysis is for a third party a cryptanalyst to gain as much information as possible about the original plaintext attempting to break the encryption to read the ciphertext and learning the secret key so future messages can be decrypted and read a mathematical technique to do this is called a cryptographic attack cryptographic attacks can be characterized in a number of ways amount of information available to the attacker cryptanalytical attacks can be classified based on what type of information the attacker has available as a basic starting point it is normally assumed that for the purposes of analysis the general algorithm is known this is shannons maxim the enemy knows the system  in its turn equivalent to kerckhoffss principle this is a reasonable assumption in practice  throughout history there are countless examples of secret algorithms falling into wider knowledge variously through espionage betrayal and reverse engineering and on occasion ciphers have been broken through pure deduction for example the german lorenz cipher and the japanese purple code and a variety of classical schemes ciphertextonly the cryptanalyst has access only to a collection of ciphertexts or codetexts knownplaintext the attacker has a set of ciphertexts to which they know the corresponding plaintext chosenplaintext chosenciphertext the attacker can obtain the ciphertexts plaintexts corresponding to an arbitrary set of plaintexts ciphertexts of their own choosing adaptive chosenplaintext like a chosenplaintext attack except the attacker can choose subsequent plaintexts based on information learned from previous encryptions similarly to the adaptive chosen ciphertext attack relatedkey attack like a chosenplaintext attack except the attacker can obtain ciphertexts encrypted under two different keys the keys are unknown but the relationship between them is known for example two keys that differ in the one bit computational resources required attacks can also be characterised by the resources they require those resources include time  the number of computation steps eg test encryptions which must be performed memory  the amount of storage required to perform the attack data  the quantity and type of plaintexts and ciphertexts required for a particular approach it is sometimes difficult to predict these quantities precisely especially when the attack is not practical to actually implement for testing but academic cryptanalysts tend to provide at least the estimated order of magnitude of their attacks difficulty saying for example sha collisions now  bruce schneier notes that even computationally impractical attacks can be considered breaks breaking a cipher simply means finding a weakness in the cipher that can be exploited with a complexity less than brute force never mind that bruteforce might require  encryptions an attack requiring  encryptions would be considered a breaksimply put a break can just be a certificational weakness evidence that the cipher does not perform as advertised partial breaks the results of cryptanalysis can also vary in usefulness cryptographer lars knudsen  classified various types of attack on block ciphers according to the amount and quality of secret information that was discovered total break  the attacker deduces the secret key global deduction  the attacker discovers a functionally equivalent algorithm for encryption and decryption but without learning the key instance local deduction  the attacker discovers additional plaintexts or ciphertexts not previously known information deduction  the attacker gains some shannon information about plaintexts or ciphertexts not previously known distinguishing algorithm  the attacker can distinguish the cipher from a random permutation academic attacks are often against weakened versions of a cryptosystem such as a block cipher or hash function with some rounds removed many but not all attacks become exponentially more difficult to execute as rounds are added to a cryptosystem so its possible for the full cryptosystem to be strong even though reducedround variants are weak nonetheless partial breaks that come close to breaking the original cryptosystem may mean that a full break will follow the successful attacks on des md and sha were all preceded by attacks on weakened versions in academic cryptography a weakness or a break in a scheme is usually defined quite conservatively it might require impractical amounts of time memory or known plaintexts it also might require the attacker be able to do things many realworld attackers cant for example the attacker may need to choose particular plaintexts to be encrypted or even to ask for plaintexts to be encrypted using several keys related to the secret key furthermore it might only reveal a small amount of information enough to prove the cryptosystem imperfect but too little to be useful to realworld attackers finally an attack might only apply to a weakened version of cryptographic tools like a reducedround block cipher as a step towards breaking the full system history cryptanalysis has coevolved together with cryptography and the contest can be traced through the history of cryptographynew ciphers being designed to replace old broken designs and new cryptanalytic techniques invented to crack the improved schemes in practice they are viewed as two sides of the same coin secure cryptography requires design against possible cryptanalysis classical ciphers although the actual word cryptanalysis is relatively recent it was coined by william friedman in  methods for breaking codes and ciphers are much older david kahn notes in the codebreakers that arab scholars were the first people to systematically document cryptanalytic methods the first known recorded explanation of cryptanalysis was given by alkindi c  also known as alkindus in europe a thcentury arab polymath in risalah fi istikhraj almuamma a manuscript on deciphering cryptographic messages this treatise contains the first description of the method of frequency analysis alkindi is thus regarded as the first codebreaker in history his breakthrough work was influenced by alkhalil  who wrote the book of cryptographic messages which contains the first use of permutations and combinations to list all possible arabic words with and without vowels frequency analysis is the basic tool for breaking most classical ciphers in natural languages certain letters of the alphabet appear more often than others in english e is likely to be the most common letter in any sample of plaintext similarly the digraph th is the most likely pair of letters in english and so on frequency analysis relies on a cipher failing to hide these statistics for example in a simple substitution cipher where each letter is simply replaced with another the most frequent letter in the ciphertext would be a likely candidate for e frequency analysis of such a cipher is therefore relatively easy provided that the ciphertext is long enough to give a reasonably representative count of the letters of the alphabet that it contains alkindis invention of the frequency analysis technique for breaking monoalphabetic substitution ciphers was the most significant cryptanalytic advance until world war ii alkindis risalah fi istikhraj almuamma described the first cryptanalytic techniques including some for polyalphabetic ciphers cipher classification arabic phonetics and syntax and most importantly gave the first descriptions on frequency analysis he also covered methods of encipherments cryptanalysis of certain encipherments and statistical analysis of letters and letter combinations in arabic an important contribution of ibn adlan  was on sample size for use of frequency analysis in europe italian scholar giambattista della porta  was the author of a seminal work on cryptanalysis de furtivis literarum notis successful cryptanalysis has undoubtedly influenced history the ability to read the presumedsecret thoughts and plans of others can be a decisive advantage for example in england in  mary queen of scots was tried and executed for treason as a result of her involvement in three plots to assassinate elizabeth i of england the plans came to light after her coded correspondence with fellow conspirators was deciphered by thomas phelippes in europe during the th and th centuries the idea of a polyalphabetic substitution cipher was developed among others by the french diplomat blaise de vigenere  for some three centuries the vigenere cipher which uses a repeating key to select different encryption alphabets in rotation was considered to be completely secure le chiffre indechiffrablethe indecipherable cipher nevertheless charles babbage  and later independently friedrich kasiski  succeeded in breaking this cipher during world war i inventors in several countries developed rotor cipher machines such as arthur scherbius enigma in an attempt to minimise the repetition that had been exploited to break the vigenere system ciphers from world war i and world war ii in world war i the breaking of the zimmermann telegram was instrumental in bringing the united states into the war in world war ii the allies benefitted enormously from their joint success cryptanalysis of the german ciphers  including the enigma machine and the lorenz cipher  and japanese ciphers particularly purple and jn ultra intelligence has been credited with everything between shortening the end of the european war by up to two years to determining the eventual result the war in the pacific was similarly helped by magic intelligence cryptanalysis of enemy messages played a significant part in the allied victory in world war ii f w winterbotham quoted the western supreme allied commander dwight d eisenhower at the wars end as describing ultra intelligence as having been decisive to allied victory sir harry hinsley official historian of british intelligence in world war ii made a similar assessment about ultra saying that it shortened the war by not less than two years and probably by four years moreover he said that in the absence of ultra it is uncertain how the war would have ended in practice frequency analysis relies as much on linguistic knowledge as it does on statistics but as ciphers became more complex mathematics became more important in cryptanalysis this change was particularly evident before and during world war ii where efforts to crack axis ciphers required new levels of mathematical sophistication moreover automation was first applied to cryptanalysis in that era with the polish bomba device the british bombe the use of punched card equipment and in the colossus computers  the first electronic digital computers to be controlled by a program indicator with reciprocal machine ciphers such as the lorenz cipher and the enigma machine used by nazi germany during world war ii each message had its own key usually the transmitting operator informed the receiving operator of this message key by transmitting some plaintext andor ciphertext before the enciphered message this is termed the indicator as it indicates to the receiving operator how to set his machine to decipher the message poorly designed and implemented indicator systems allowed first polish cryptographers and then the british cryptographers at bletchley park to break the enigma cipher system similar poor indicator systems allowed the british to identify depths that led to the diagnosis of the lorenz sz cipher system and the comprehensive breaking of its messages without the cryptanalysts seeing the cipher machine depth sending two or more messages with the same key is an insecure process to a cryptanalyst the messages are then said to be in depth this may be detected by the messages having the same indicator by which the sending operator informs the receiving operator about the key generator initial settings for the message generally the cryptanalyst may benefit from lining up identical enciphering operations among a set of messages for example the vernam cipher enciphers by bitforbit combining plaintext with a long key using the exclusive or operator which is also known as modulo addition symbolized by   plaintext  key  ciphertext deciphering combines the same key bits with the ciphertext to reconstruct the plaintext ciphertext  key  plaintext in modulo arithmetic addition is the same as subtraction when two such ciphertexts are aligned in depth combining them eliminates the common key leaving just a combination of the two plaintexts ciphertext  ciphertext  plaintext  plaintext the individual plaintexts can then be worked out linguistically by trying probable words or phrases also known as cribs at various locations a correct guess when combined with the merged plaintext stream produces intelligible text from the other plaintext component cyphertext  cyphertext  plaintext  plaintext the recovered fragment of the second plaintext can often be extended in one or both directions and the extra characters can be combined with the merged plaintext stream to extend the first plaintext working back and forth between the two plaintexts using the intelligibility criterion to check guesses the analyst may recover much or all of the original plaintexts with only two plaintexts in depth the analyst may not know which one corresponds to which ciphertext but in practice this is not a large problem when a recovered plaintext is then combined with its ciphertext the key is revealed plaintext  ciphertext  key knowledge of a key then allows the analyst to read other messages encrypted with the same key and knowledge of a set of related keys may allow cryptanalysts to diagnose the system used for constructing them development of modern cryptography governments have long recognized the potential benefits of cryptanalysis for intelligence both military and diplomatic and established dedicated organizations devoted to breaking the codes and ciphers of other nations for example gchq and the nsa organizations which are still very active today even though computation was used to great effect in the cryptanalysis of the lorenz cipher and other systems during world war ii it also made possible new methods of cryptography orders of magnitude more complex than ever before taken as a whole modern cryptography has become much more impervious to cryptanalysis than the penandpaper systems of the past and now seems to have the upper hand against pure cryptanalysis the historian david kahn notes many are the cryptosystems offered by the hundreds of commercial vendors today that cannot be broken by any known methods of cryptanalysis indeed in such systems even a chosen plaintext attack in which a selected plaintext is matched against its ciphertext cannot yield the key that unlocks other messages in a sense then cryptanalysis is dead but that is not the end of the story cryptanalysis may be dead but there is  to mix my metaphors  more than one way to skin a cat kahn goes on to mention increased opportunities for interception bugging side channel attacks and quantum computers as replacements for the traditional means of cryptanalysis in  former nsa technical director brian snow said that both academic and government cryptographers are moving very slowly forward in a mature field however any postmortems for cryptanalysis may be premature while the effectiveness of cryptanalytic methods employed by intelligence agencies remains unknown many serious attacks against both academic and practical cryptographic primitives have been published in the modern era of computer cryptography the block cipher madryga proposed in  but not widely used was found to be susceptible to ciphertextonly attacks in  feal proposed as a replacement for the des standard encryption algorithm but not widely used was demolished by a spate of attacks from the academic community many of which are entirely practical the a a cmea and dect systems used in mobile and wireless phone technology can all be broken in hours minutes or even in realtime using widely available computing equipment bruteforce keyspace search has broken some realworld ciphers and applications including singledes see eff des cracker bit exportstrength cryptography and the dvd content scramble system in  wired equivalent privacy wep a protocol used to secure wifi wireless networks was shown to be breakable in practice because of a weakness in the rc cipher and aspects of the wep design that made relatedkey attacks practical wep was later replaced by wifi protected access in  researchers conducted a proofofconcept break of ssl using weaknesses in the md hash function and certificate issuer practices that made it possible to exploit collision attacks on hash functions the certificate issuers involved changed their practices to prevent the attack from being repeated thus while the best modern ciphers may be far more resistant to cryptanalysis than the enigma cryptanalysis and the broader field of information security remain quite active symmetric ciphers boomerang attack bruteforce attack davies attack differential cryptanalysis harvest now decrypt later impossible differential cryptanalysis improbable differential cryptanalysis integral cryptanalysis linear cryptanalysis meetinthemiddle attack modn cryptanalysis relatedkey attack sandwich attack slide attack xsl attack asymmetric ciphers asymmetric cryptography or publickey cryptography is cryptography that relies on using two mathematically related keys one private and one public such ciphers invariably rely on hard mathematical problems as the basis of their security so an obvious point of attack is to develop methods for solving the problem the security of twokey cryptography depends on mathematical questions in a way that singlekey cryptography generally does not and conversely links cryptanalysis to wider mathematical research in a new way asymmetric schemes are designed around the conjectured difficulty of solving various mathematical problems if an improved algorithm can be found to solve the problem then the system is weakened for example the security of the diffiehellman key exchange scheme depends on the difficulty of calculating the discrete logarithm in  don coppersmith found a faster way to find discrete logarithms in certain groups and thereby requiring cryptographers to use larger groups or different types of groups rsas security depends in part upon the difficulty of integer factorization  a breakthrough in factoring would impact the security of rsa in  one could factor a difficult digit number at an expense of  elementary computer operations by  the state of the art in factoring algorithms had advanced to a point where a digit number could be factored in  operations advances in computing technology also meant that the operations could be performed much faster moores law predicts that computer speeds will continue to increase factoring techniques may continue to do so as well but will most likely depend on mathematical insight and creativity neither of which has ever been successfully predictable digit numbers of the kind once used in rsa have been factored the effort was greater than above but was not unreasonable on fast modern computers by the start of the st century digit numbers were no longer considered a large enough key size for rsa numbers with several hundred digits were still considered too hard to factor in  though methods will probably continue to improve over time requiring key size to keep pace or other methods such as elliptic curve cryptography to be used another distinguishing feature of asymmetric schemes is that unlike attacks on symmetric cryptosystems any cryptanalysis has the opportunity to make use of knowledge gained from the public key attacking cryptographic hash systems birthday attack hash function security summary rainbow table sidechannel attacks blackbag cryptanalysis maninthemiddle attack power analysis replay attack rubberhose cryptanalysis timing analysis quantum computing applications for cryptanalysis quantum computers which are still in the early phases of research have potential use in cryptanalysis for example shors algorithm could factor large numbers in polynomial time in effect breaking some commonly used forms of publickey encryption by using grovers algorithm on a quantum computer bruteforce key search can be made quadratically faster however this could be countered by doubling the key length see also economics of security global
