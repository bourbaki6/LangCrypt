asia  ayzh uk also aysh is the largest continent in the world by both land area and population it covers an area of more than  million square kilometres about  of earths total land area and  of earths total surface area the continent which has long been home to the majority of the human population was the site of many of the first civilisations its  billion people constitute roughly  of the worlds population asia shares the landmass of eurasia with europe and of afroeurasia with both europe and africa in general terms it is bounded on the east by the pacific ocean on the south by the indian ocean and on the north by the arctic ocean the border of asia with europe is a historical and cultural construct as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them a commonly accepted division places asia to the east of the suez canal separating it from africa and to the east of the turkish straits the ural mountains and ural river and to the south of the caucasus mountains and the caspian and black seas separating it from europe since the concept of asia derives from the term for the eastern region from a european perspective asia is the remaining vast area of eurasia minus europe therefore asia is a region where various independent cultures coexist rather than sharing a single culture and its boundary with europe is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity the division of eurasia into two continents reflects eastwest cultural differences some of which vary on a spectrum china and india traded places as the largest economies in the world from  to  ce china was a major economic power for much of recorded history with the highest gdp per capita until  the silk road became the main eastwest trading route in the asian hinterlands while the straits of malacca stood as a major sea route asia has exhibited economic dynamism as well as robust population growth during the th century but overall population growth has since fallen asia was the birthplace of most of the worlds mainstream religions including buddhism christianity confucianism hinduism islam jainism judaism sikhism taoism zoroastrianism and many other religions asia varies greatly across and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups cultures environments economics historical ties and government systems it also has a mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot deserts in parts of west asia central asia and south asia temperate areas in the east and the continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in north asia etymology the term asia is believed to originate in the bronze age toponym assuwa hittite  romanized assuwa which originally referred only to a portion of northwestern anatolia the term appears in hittite records recounting how a confederation of assuwan states including troy unsuccessfully rebelled against the hittite king tudhaliya i around  bce roughly contemporary linear b documents contain the term aswia mycenaean greek  romanized asiwija seemingly in reference to captives from the same area herodotus used the term in reference to anatolia and the territory of the achaemenid empire in contrast to greece and egypt he reports that greeks assumed that asia was named after the wife of prometheus but that lydians say it was named after asies son of cotys who passed the name on to a tribe at sardis in greek mythology asia  or  was the name of a nymph or titan goddess of lydia the iliad attributed by the ancient greeks to homer mentions two phrygians in the trojan war named asios literally asian and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in lydia as  the term was later adopted by the romans who used it in reference to the province of asia located in western anatolia one of the first writers to use asia as a name of the whole continent was pliny definition asiaeurope boundary the threefold division of the old world into africa asia and europe has been in use since the th century bce due to greek geographers such as anaximander and hecataeus anaximander placed the boundary between asia and europe along the phasis river now the rioni in georgia of caucasus from its mouth by poti on the black sea coast through the surami pass and along the kura river to the caspian sea a convention still followed by herodotus in the th century bce during the hellenistic period this convention was revised and the boundary between europe and asia was now considered to be the tanais the modern don river this is the convention used by roman era authors such as posidonius strabo and ptolemy the border between asia and europe was historically defined by european academics in sweden five years after peters death in  philip johan von strahlenberg published a new atlas proposing the ural mountains as the border of asia tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von strahlenberg the latter had suggested the emba river as the lower boundary over the next century various proposals were made until the ural river prevailed in the midth century the border had been moved perforce from the black sea to the caspian sea into which the ural river projects the border between the black sea and the caspian is often placed along the crest of the caucasus mountains although it is sometimes placed further north on the kumamanych depression asiaafrica boundary the boundary between asia and africa is the suez canal the gulf of suez the red sea and the babelmandeb this makes egypt a transcontinental country with the sinai peninsula in asia and the remainder of the country in africa asiaoceania boundary the border between asia and oceania is usually placed somewhere in the indonesian archipelago specifically in eastern indonesia the wallace line separates the asian and wallacea biogeographical realms a transition zone of deep water straits between the asian and australian continental shelves webers line split the region in two with regard to the balance of fauna between asian origin or australopapuan origin wallaceas eastern boundary with sahul is represented by the lydekkers line the maluku islands except the aru islands are often considered to lie on the border of southeast asia with the aru islands and western new guinea to the east of the lydekkers line being wholly part of oceania as both lie on the australian continental plate culturally the wallacea region denoted the transition between austronesian and melanesian people with varying degrees of intermixing between the two in general the further west and coastal a region is the stronger the austronesian influences and the further east and inland a region is the stronger the melanesian influences the terms southeast asia and oceania devised in the th century have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception the chief factor in determining which islands of the indonesian archipelago are asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there not all european lewis and wigen assert the narrowing of southeast asia to its present boundaries was thus a gradual process asianorth america boundary the bering strait and bering sea separate the landmasses of asia and north america as well as forming the international boundary between russia and the united states this national and continental boundary separates the diomede islands in the bering strait with big diomede in russia and little diomede in the united states the aleutian islands are an island chain extending westward from the alaskan peninsula toward russias komandorski islands and kamchatka peninsula most of them are always associated with north america except for the westernmost near islands group which is on asias continental shelf beyond the north aleutians basin and on rare occasions could be associated with asia which could then allow the united states to be considered a transcontinental state the aleutian islands are sometimes associated with oceania owing to their status as remote pacific islands and their proximity to the pacific plate this is extremely rare however due to their nontropical biogeography as well as their inhabitants who have historically been related to the indigenous peoples of the americas st lawrence island in the northern bering sea belongs to the us state of alaska and may be associated with either continent but is almost always considered part of north america as with the rat islands in the aleutian chain at their nearest points alaska and russia are separated by only  kilometres  miles ongoing definition geographical asia is a cultural artifact of european conceptions of the world beginning with the ancient greeks being imposed onto other cultures an imprecise concept causing endemic contention about what it means asia does not exactly correspond to the cultural borders of its various types of constituents from the time of herodotus a minority of geographers have rejected the threecontinent system europe africa asia on the grounds that there is no substantial physical separation between them for example sir barry cunliffe the emeritus professor of european archeology at oxford argues that europe has been geographically and culturally merely the western excrescence of the continent of asia geographically asia is the major eastern constituent of the continent of eurasia with europe being a northwestern peninsula of the landmass asia europe and africa make up a single continuous landmassafroeurasiaand share a common continental shelf almost all of europe and a major part of asia sit atop the eurasian plate adjoined on the south by the arabian and indian plate and with the easternmost part of siberia east of the chersky range on the north american plate history prehistory about  million years ago homo erectus left the african continent this species is believed to have lived in east and southeast asia from  million to  years ago researchers believe that the modern human or homo sapiens migrated about  years ago to south asia along the indian ocean modern humans interbred with an archaic human species called denisovans in southeast asia before the arrival of modern humans flores was occupied by homo floresiensis a small archaic human ancestors of east eurasians split from ancient west eurasians about  years ago migrating out of the hub in the iranian plateau evidence from full genomic studies suggests that the first people in the americas diverged from ancient east asians about  years ago and expanded northwards into siberia where they encountered and interacted with a different paleolithic siberian population known as ancient north eurasians giving rise to both paleosiberian peoples and ancient native americans modern south asians are descendants of a combination of western eurasian ancestries notably neolithic iranian and western steppe herder components with a proposed indigenous east eurasian component termed ancient ancestral south indians closest to the nonwest eurasian part extracted from south asian samples distantly related to the andamanese peoples east asians and aboriginal australians ancient era the history of asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions east asia south asia southeast asia central asia and west asia the coastal periphery was home to some of the worlds earliest known civilisations each of them developing around fertile river valleys the civilisations in mesopotamia the indus valley and the yellow river shared many similarities these civilisations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel other innovations such as writing seem to have been developed individually in each area cities states and empires developed in these lowlands the central steppe region had long been inhabited by horsemounted nomads who could reach all areas of asia from the steppes the earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the indoeuropeans who spread their languages into west asia south asia and the borders of china where the tocharians resided the northernmost part of asia including much of siberia was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads owing to the dense forests climate and tundra these areas remained very sparsely populated the center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts the caucasus and himalaya mountains and the karakum and gobi deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty while the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe however the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large equestrian force for this and other reasons the nomads who conquered states in china india and the middle east often found themselves adapting to the local more affluent societies medieval era the islamic caliphates defeats of the byzantine and persian empires led to west asia and southern parts of central asia and western parts of south asia under its control during its conquests of the th century islam also spread over centuries to the southern regions of india and southeast asia through trade along the maritime silk road the mongol empire conquered a large part of asia in the th century an area extending from china to europe before the mongol invasion song dynasty reportedly had approximately  million citizens the  census which followed the invasion reported roughly  million people the black death one of the most devastating pandemics in human history is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central asia where it then travelled along the silk road modern era european involvement in asia became more significant from the age of discovery onward with iberiansponsored sailors such as christopher columbus and vasco da gama paving the way for new routes from atlantic europe to pacific asia and the indian ocean respectively in the late th century the russian empire also began to expand into northwestern asia from the th century and would eventually take control of all of siberia and most of central asia by the end of the th century among noneuropean empires the ottoman empire controlled anatolia most of the middle east north africa and the balkans from the mid th century onward while in the th century the manchu conquered china and established the qing dynasty the islamic mughal empire preceded by the delhi sultanate of the th to early th century and the hindu maratha empire controlled much of india in the th and th centuries respectively western imperialism in asia from the th to th centuries coincided with the industrial revolution in the west and the dethroning of india and china as the worlds foremost economies the british empire first became dominant in south asia with most of the region being conquered by british traders in the late th and early th centuries before falling under direct british rule after a failed  revolt the  completion of the suez canal which increased british access to india went on to further european influence over africa and asia around this time western powers started to dominate china in what later became known as the century of humiliation with the britishsupported opium trade and later opium wars resulting in china being forced into an unprecedented situation of importing more than it exported foreign domination of china was furthered by the japanese colonial empire which controlled some of east asia and briefly much of southeast asia which had earlier been taken over by the british dutch and french in the late th century new guinea and the pacific islands japans domination was enabled by its rapid rise that had taken place during the meiji era of the late th century in which it applied industrial knowledge learned from the west and thus overtook the rest of asia one significant influence on japan had been the united states which had begun projecting influence across the pacific after its earlytomidth century westward expansion the breakup of the ottoman empire in the early th century led to the middle east also being contested and partitioned by the british and french contemporary era with the end of world war ii in  and the wartime ruination of europe and imperial japan many countries in asia were able to rapidly free themselves of colonial rule the independence of india came along with the carving out of a separate nation for the majority of south asian muslims which in  further split into pakistan and bangladesh the cold war in asia strained relations between india and pakistan and affected asia more generally the end of the cold war and the soviet union by  saw the independence of the five modern central asian countries some arab countries took economic advantage of massive oil deposits that were discovered in their territory becoming globally influential though stability in the middle east has been affected since  by the arabisraeli conflict and americanled interventions east asian nations along with singapore in southeast asia became economically prosperous with highgrowth tiger economies china having undergone the reform and opening up under deng xiaoping regained its place among the top two economies of the world by the st century india has also grown significantly because of economic liberalisation that started in the s with extreme poverty now below  india and chinas rise has coincided with growing tensions between the two with the indopacific now an actively contested area between china and counterbalancing forces geography asia is the largest continent on earth it covers  of the earths total surface area or  of its land area and has the longest coastline at  kilometres  mi asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern fourfifths of eurasia it is located to the east of the suez canal and the ural mountains and south of the caucasus mountains or the kumamanych depression and the caspian and black seas it is bounded on the east by the pacific ocean on the south by the indian ocean and on the north by the arctic ocean asia is subdivided into  countries five of them georgia azerbaijan russia kazakhstan and turkey are transcontinental countries lying partly in europe geographically russia is partly and mostly in asia but is considered a european nation both culturally and politically the gobi desert is in mongolia and the arabian desert stretches across much of the middle east the yangtze in china is the longest river in the continent the himalayas between nepal and china is the tallest mountain range in the world tropical rainforests stretch across much of southern asia and coniferous and deciduous forests lie farther north main regions there are various approaches to the regional division of asia the following subdivision into regions is used among others by the united nations statistics division unsd this division of asia into regions by the united nations is done solely for statistical reasons and does not imply any assumption about political or other affiliations of countries and territories north asia siberia central asia west asia the middle east or near east and part of the caucasus south asia indian subcontinent east asia far east southeast asia east indies and indochina climate asia has extremely diverse climate features climates range from arctic and subarctic in siberia to tropical in southern india and southeast asia it is moist across southeast sections and dry across much of the interior some of the largest daily temperature ranges on earth occur in western sections of asia the monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections due to the presence of the himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer southwestern sections of the continent are hot siberia is one of the coldest places in the northern hemisphere and can act as a source of arctic air masses for north america the most active place on earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the philippines and south of japan climate change politics the most democratic countries in asia are japan taiwan and south korea

angus maddison india had the worlds largest economy for much of the past three millennia prior to the th century accounting for  of the worlds industrial output china was the largest and most advanced economy on earth for much of recorded history and shared the mantle with india for several decades in the late twentieth century japan was the largest economy in asia and secondlargest in the world

singapore call centers and business process outsourcing firms bpos are becoming major employers in india and the philippines due to the availability of a large pool of highly skilled englishspeaking workers the increased use of outsourcing has assisted the rise of india and the china as financial centers due to its large and extremely competitive information technology industry india has become a major hub for outsourcing trade between asian countries and countries on other continents is largely carried out on the sea routes that are important for asia individual main routes have emerged from this the main route leads from the chinese coast south via hanoi to jakarta singapore and kuala lumpur through the strait of malacca via colombo to the southern tip of india via male to east african mombasa see also indopacific from there to djibouti then through the red sea over the suez canal into mediterranean see also indomediterranean there via haifa istanbul and athens to the upper adriatic to the northern italian hub of trieste with its rail connections to central and eastern europe or further to barcelona and around spain and france to the european northern ports a far smaller part of the goods traffic runs via south africa to europe a particularly significant part of asian goods traffic is carried out on the pacific rim toward los angeles and long beach the melting of the arctic is also paving the way for new shipping routes from northeast asia to europe and north america the land route to europe is also the subject of construction projects comparatively smaller in scope

tells about an avatar of vishnu in the form of a fish who warned manu of a terrible flood ancient chinese mythology also tells of a great flood spanning generations one that required the combined efforts of emperors and divinities to control abrahamic the abrahamic religions including judaism christianity islam druze faith and bahai faith originated in west asia judaism the oldest of the abrahamic faiths is practiced primarily in israel the indigenous homeland and historical birthplace of the hebrew nation which today consists both of those jews who remained in the middle east and those who returned from diaspora in europe north america and other regions though various diaspora communities persist worldwide jews are the predominant ethnic group in israel  numbering at about  million although the levels of adherence to jewish religion vary outside of israel there are small ancient jewish communities in turkey  azerbaijan  iran  india  and uzbekistan  among many other places as of  there are am estimated  million  est jews alive in the world today making them one of the smallest asian minorities at roughly  of the total population of the continent christianity is a widespread religion in asia with more than  million adherents in  according to pew research center and nearly  million according to britannica book of the year  christians constitute around  of the total population of asia in the philippines and timorleste catholicism is the predominant religion it was introduced by the spaniards and the portuguese respectively in armenia and georgia eastern orthodoxy is the predominant religion in the middle east such as in the levant anatolia and fars syriac christianity church of the east and oriental orthodoxy are prevalent minority denominations which are both eastern christian sects mainly adhered to assyrian people or syriac christians vibrant indigenous minorities in west asia are adhering to the eastern catholic churches and eastern orthodoxy saint thomas christians in india trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of thomas the apostle in the st century significant christian communities also found in central asia south asia southeast asia and east asia islam which originated in the hejaz located in modernday saudi arabia is the second largest and most widelyspread religion in asia with at least  billion muslims constituting around  of the total population of asia with  of the world muslim population the country currently with the largest muslim population in the world is indonesia followed by pakistan  india  bangladesh iran and turkey mecca medina and jerusalem are the three holiest cities for islam in all the world the hajj and umrah attract large numbers of muslim devotees from all over the world to mecca and medina iran is the largest shia country the druze originated in west asia is a monotheistic religion based on the teachings of figures like hamza ibn ali and alhakim biamr allah and greek philosophers such as plato and aristotle the number of druze people worldwide is around one million around  live in syria  to  live in lebanon and less than  live in israel recently there has been a growing druze diaspora the bahai faith originated in asia in iran persia and spread from there to the ottoman empire central asia india and burma during the lifetime of bahaullah since the middle of the th century growth has particularly occurred in other asian countries because bahai activities in many muslim countries has been severely suppressed by authorities lotus temple is a big bahai temple in india indian and east asian religions almost all asian religions have philosophical character and asian philosophical traditions cover a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings indian philosophy includes hindu philosophy and buddhist philosophy they include elements of nonmaterial pursuits whereas another school of thought from india carvaka preached the enjoyment of the material world the religions of hinduism buddhism jainism and sikhism originated in india south asia in east asia particularly in china and japan confucianism taoism and zen buddhism took shape as of  hinduism has around  billion adherents the faith represents around  of asias population and is the largest religion in asia however it is mostly concentrated in south asia over  of the populations of both india and nepal adhere to hinduism alongside significant communities in bangladesh pakistan bhutan sri lanka and bali indonesia many overseas indians in countries such as burma singapore and malaysia also adhere to hinduism buddhism has a great following in mainland southeast asia and east asia buddhism is the religion of the majority of the populations of cambodia  thailand  burma  japan  bhutan  sri lanka  laos  and mongolia  taiwan  south korea  malaysia  nepal  vietnam  china  north korea  and small communities in india and bangladesh the communistgoverned countries of china vietnam and north korea are officially atheist thus the number of buddhists and other religious adherents may be underreported jainism is found mainly in india and in overseas indian communities such as the united states and malaysia sikhism is found in northern india and amongst overseas indian communities in other parts of asia especially southeast asia confucianism is found predominantly in mainland china south korea taiwan and in overseas chinese populations taoism is found mainly in mainland china taiwan malaysia and singapore in many chinese communities taoism is easily syncretised with mahayana buddhism thus exact religious statistics are difficult to obtain and may be understated or overstated culture the culture of asia is a diverse blend of customs and traditions that have been practiced by the various ethnic groups of the continent for centuries the continent is divided into six geographic subregions central asia east asia north asia south asia southeast asia and west asia these regions are defined by their cultural similarities including common religions languages and ethnicities west asia also known as southwest asia or the middle east has cultural roots in the ancient civilisations of the fertile crescent and mesopotamia which gave rise to the persian arab ottoman empires as well as the abrahamic religions of judaism christianity and islam these civilisations which are located in the hilly flanks are among the oldest in the world with evidence of farming dating back to around  bce despite the challenges posed by the vast size of the continent and the presence of natural barriers such as deserts and mountain ranges trade and commerce have helped to create a panasian culture that is shared across the region nobel laureates rabindranath
