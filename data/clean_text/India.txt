india officially the republic of india is a country in south asia it is the seventhlargest country by area the most populous country since  and since its independence in  the worlds most populous democracy bounded by the indian ocean on the south the arabian sea on the southwest and the bay of bengal on the southeast it shares land borders with pakistan to the west china nepal and bhutan to the north and bangladesh and myanmar to the east in the indian ocean india is near sri lanka and the maldives its andaman and nicobar islands share a maritime border with myanmar thailand and indonesia modern humans arrived on the indian subcontinent from africa no later than  years ago their long occupation predominantly in isolation as huntergatherers has made the region highly diverse settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the indus river basin  years ago evolving gradually into the indus valley civilisation of the third millennium bce by  bce an archaic form of sanskrit an indoeuropean language had diffused into india from the northwest its hymns recorded the early dawnings of hinduism in india indias preexisting dravidian languages were supplanted in the northern regions by  bce caste had emerged within hinduism and buddhism and jainism had arisen proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity early political consolidations gave rise to the looseknit maurya and gupta empires this era was noted for creativity in art architecture and writing but the status of women declined and untouchability became an organised belief in south india the middle kingdoms exported dravidian language scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of southeast asia in the st millennium islam christianity judaism and zoroastrianism became established on indias southern and western coasts in the early centuries of the nd millennium muslim armies from central asia intermittently overran indias northern plains the resulting delhi sultanate drew northern india into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval islam in south india the vijayanagara empire created a longlasting composite hindu culture in the punjab sikhism emerged rejecting institutionalised religion the mughal empire ushered in two centuries of economic expansion and relative peace and left a rich architectural legacy gradually expanding rule of the british east india company turned india into a colonial economy but consolidated its sovereignty british crown rule began in  the rights promised to indians were granted slowly but technological changes were introduced and modern ideas of education and the public life took root a nationalist movement emerged in india the first in the noneuropean british empire and an influence on other nationalist movements noted for nonviolent resistance after  it became the primary factor in ending british rule in  the british indian empire was partitioned into two independent dominions a hindumajority dominion of india and a muslimmajority dominion of pakistan a largescale loss of life and an unprecedented migration accompanied the partition india has been a federal republic since  governed through a democratic parliamentary system it is a pluralistic multilingual and multiethnic society indias population grew from  million in  to over  billion in  during this time its nominal per capita income increased from us annually to us and its literacy rate from  to  a comparatively destitute country in  india has become a fastgrowing major economy and a hub for information technology services with an expanding middle class india has reduced its poverty rate though at the cost of increasing economic inequality it is a nuclearweapon state that ranks high in military expenditure it has disputes over kashmir with its neighbours pakistan and china unresolved since the midth century among the socioeconomic challenges india faces are gender inequality child malnutrition and rising levels of air pollution indias land is megadiverse with four biodiversity hotspots indias wildlife which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in its culture is supported in protected habitats etymology according to the oxford english dictionary the english proper noun india derives most immediately from the classical latin india a reference to a looselydefined historical region of asia stretching from south asia to the borders of china further etymons are hellenistic greek india  ancient greek indos  or the river indus achaemenian old persian hindu an eastern province of the achaemenid empire and sanskrit sindhu or river but specifically the indus river and by extension its wellsettled basin the ancient greeks referred to south asians as indoi the people of the indus the term bharat bharat pronounced bat  mentioned in both indian epic poetry and the constitution of india is used in its variations by many indian languages a modern rendering of the historical name bharatavarsha which applied originally to north india bharat gained increased currency from the midth century as a native name for india hindustan ndstan  is a middle persian name for india that became popular by the th century and was used widely since the era of the mughal empire the meaning of hindustan has varied referring to a region encompassing the northern indian subcontinent presentday northern india and pakistan or to india in its near entirety history ancient india based on coalescence of mitochondrial dna and y chromosome data it is thought that the earliest extant lineages of anatomically modern humans or homo sapiens on the indian subcontinent had reached there from africa between  and  years ago and with high likelihood by  years ago their long occupation initially in varying forms of isolation as huntergatherers has made the region highly diverse second only to africa in human genetic diversity however the earliest known modern human fossils in south asia date to about  years ago evidence for the neolithic period in the western margins of the indus river basin at mehrgarh in balochistan pakistan dates to after  bce domestication of grainproducing plants including barley and animals including humped zebu cattle occurred here these cultures gradually evolved into the indus valley civilisation which flourished during  bce in pakistan and western india centred around cities such as mohenjodaro harappa dholavira ganweriwala and rakhigarhi its characteristic features included standardised weights steatite seals a written script urban planning public works and arts and crafts including pottery styles terracotta human figures and animal statuettes networks of towns and villages grew around the cities in a new agropastoral economy between  bce and  bce an archaic form of sanskrit an indoeuropean language diffused into india from the northwest its evidence today is found in the rig vedathe oldest scripture associated with what later became hinduismwhich was composed by indoaryanspeaking tribes migrating east from what is today northern afghanistan and across the punjab region the settling of the ganges river plain took place during the next millennium when large swathes of the river systems adjoining regions were deforested at times by setting fires or later by employing iron implements and prepared for agriculture the settlement may have involved driving the preexisting people out or enslaving them the dravidian languages of india were supplanted in the north creating a broad language familiydivide with the indoaryan languages being spoken mainly in the north and west and the dravidian in some parts of east india and most of the south classical sanskrit a refined and standardised grammatical form would emerge in the midst millennium bce and was codified in the astadhyayi eight chapters of panini the two major sanskrit epics the mahabharata and the ramayana however were composed in a range of oral storytelling registers called epic sanskrit which was used in northern india between  bce and  ce and roughly contemporary with classical sanskrit a second urbanisation had taken place in south asia by  bce this time on the ganges plain in fortified cities social differentiation by caste or varna had emerged by the midmillennium two new ethical and social systems had arisen jainism based on the teachings of mahavira and buddhism on those of the buddha both religions stressed nonviolence and abjured animal sacrifices conducted in brahmanism and birth into a fixed hereditary varna by living ethically lay people could rise socially and morally in these religions chronicling the life of the buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in india the rise of the two religions was a backdrop to the emergence of the first looseknit geographically extensive power in south asia the maurya empire during the rule of the founders grandson ashoka ca  bce the empire briefly controlled the major urban hubs and arteries of the subcontinent except in the deep south the empires period was notable for creativity in art architecture inscriptions and produced texts but also for the declining rights of women in the mainstream indoaryan speaking regions after the kalinga war in which his troops visited great violence on the region ashoka embraced buddhism and promoted its tenets in edicts scattered across south asia as the edicts forbade both the killing of wild animals and the destruction of forests ashoka is seen by some modern environmental historians as an early embodiment of that ethos by the th and th centuries the gupta empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater ganges plain this system became a model for later indian kingdoms under the guptas a renewed hinduism based on devotion rather than the management of ritual began to assert itself the renewal was reflected in a flowering of art literature and science in south india the sangam literature of the tamil language reveals that between  bce and  ce the southern peninsula was ruled by the cheras and the cholas along the western and eastern plains respectively of the kaveri river valley and the pandyas farther south along the vaigai river valley by the sixth century the pallavas had grown into a regional power simultaneously buddhism and jainism which had favoured a conservative transactionalism were replaced by kingly devotion to the gods of particular places which became a characteristic of the bhakti movement the pallavas in particular traded extensively with the roman empire and with west and southeast asia medieval india the indian early medieval age from  to  ce was defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity no ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region during this time pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society as were new nontraditional ruling classes the caste system consequently began to show regional differences in the th and th centuries the first devotional hymns were composed in tamil they were imitated all over india and led to both the resurgence of hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent indian royalty big and small and the temples they patronised drew citizens in significant numbers to the capital cities which became economic hubs as well temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as india underwent another urbanisation by the th and th centuries the effects were felt in southeast asia as south indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modernday myanmar thailand laos brunei cambodia vietnam philippines malaysia and indonesia indian merchants scholars and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission southeast asians took the initiative as well with many sojourning in indian seminaries and translating buddhist and hindu texts into their languages after the th century muslim central asian nomadic clans using swifthorse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity repeatedly overran south asias northwestern plains leading eventually to the establishment of the islamic delhi sultanate in  the sultanate was to control much of north india and to make many forays into south india although at first disruptive for the indian elites the sultanate largely left its vast nonmuslim subject population to its own laws and customs by repeatedly repulsing mongol raiders in the th century the sultanate saved india from the devastation visited on west and central asia setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers learned men mystics traders artists and artisans from that region into the subcontinent thereby creating a syncretic indoislamic culture in the north the sultanates raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of south india paved the way for the indigenous vijayanagara empire embracing a strong shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate the empire came to control much of peninsular india and was to influence south indian society for long afterwards early modern india in the early th century northern india then under mainly muslim rulers fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of central asian warriors the resulting mughal empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule instead it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices and diverse and inclusive ruling elites leading to more systematic centralised and uniform rule eschewing tribal bonds and islamic identity especially under akbar the mughals united their farflung realms through loyaltyexpressed through a persianised cultureto an emperor who had neardivine status the mughal states economic policies deriving most revenues from agriculture and mandating that taxes be paid in the wellregulated silver currency caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets the relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the th century was a factor in indias economic expansion resulting in greater patronage of painting literary forms textiles and architecture newly coherent social groups in northern and western india such as the marathas the rajputs and the sikhs gained military and governing ambitions during mughal rule which through collaboration or adversity gave them both recognition and military experience expanding commerce during mughal rule gave rise to new indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern india as the empire disintegrated many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs by the early th century with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred several european trading companies including the english east india company had established coastal outposts the east india companys control of the seas greater resources and more advanced military training and technology led it to assert its military strength increasingly and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the indian elite these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the bengal region by  and sideline the other european companies its further access to the riches of bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annexe or subdue most of india by the s india was no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had but instead supplying the british empire with raw materials many historians consider this to be the onset of indias colonial period by this time with its economic power severely curtailed by the british parliament and having effectively been made an arm of british administration the east india company began more consciously to enter noneconomic arenas including education social reform and culture modern india the appointment in  of lord dalhousie as governor general of the east india company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty the surveillance of the population and the education of citizens technological changesamong them railways canals and the telegraphwere introduced not long after their introduction in europe disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the indian rebellion of  fed by diverse resentments and perceptions including invasive britishstyle social reforms harsh land taxes and summary treatment of some wealthy landowners and princes the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central india and shook the foundations of company rule after the rebellion was suppressed in  the east india company was disbanded and the british government began to directly administer india proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited britishstyle parliamentary system the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest in the decades following public life gradually emerged all over india leading eventually to the founding of the indian national congress in  the rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the th century was marked by economic setbacks and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of faraway markets there was an increase in the number of largescale famines and despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by indian taxpayers little industrial employment was generated for indians however commercial cropping especially in the newly canalled punjab led to increased food production for internal consumption the railway network provided critical famine relief notably reduced the cost of moving goods and helped nascent indianowned industry after world war i in which approximately one million indians served a new period began it was marked by british reforms but also repressive legislation by more strident indian calls for selfrule and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of noncooperation led by mahatma gandhi during the s the british enacted slow legislative reform the indian national congress won victories in the resulting elections the next decade was beset with crises indian participation in world war ii the congresss final push for noncooperation and an upsurge of muslim nationalism all were capped by the advent of independence in  but tempered by the partition of india into two states india and pakistan indias constitution was adopted in  and established a secular democratic republic economic liberalisation has created a large urban middle class and transformed india into a fast growing economy however india has been hamstrung by persistent poverty both rural and urban religious and casterelated violence maoistinspired naxalite insurgencies and separatism in jammu and kashmir and in northeast india india has unresolved territorial disputes with china and with pakistan geography india accounts for the bulk of the indian subcontinent lying atop the indian tectonic plate and a part of the indoaustralian plate indias defining geologic processes began approximately  million years ago when the indian plate then part of the southern supercontinent gondwana began a northeastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its southwest and later south and southeast simultaneously the vast tethyan oceanic crust to its northeast began to subduct under the eurasian plate the indian continental crust however was obstructed and was sheared horizontally its lower crust and mantle slid under but the upper layer piled up in sheets or nappes ahead of the subduction zone this created the orogeny or process of mountain building of the himalayas the middle and stiffer layer continued to push into tibet causing crustal thickening of the tibetan plateau immediately south of the emerging himalayas plate movement created a vast crescentshaped trough that rapidly filled with riverborne sediment and now constitutes the indogangetic plain the original indian plate makes its first appearance above the sediment in the ancient aravalli range which extends from the delhi ridge in a southwesterly direction to the west lies the thar desert the eastern spread of which is checked by the aravallis the remaining indian plate survives as peninsular india the oldest and geologically most stable part of india it extends as far north as the satpura and vindhya ranges in central india these parallel chains run from the arabian sea coast in gujarat in the west to the coalrich chota nagpur plateau in jharkhand in the east to the south the remaining peninsular landmass the deccan plateau is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the western and eastern ghats the plateau contains the countrys oldest rock formations some over one billion years old constituted in such fashion india lies to the north of the equator between   and   north latitude and   and   east longitude major himalayanorigin rivers that substantially flow through india include the ganges and the brahmaputra both of which drain into the bay of bengal important tributaries of the ganges include the yamuna and the kosi the kosis extremely low gradient caused by longterm silt deposition leads to severe floods and course changes major peninsular rivers whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding include the godavari the mahanadi the kaveri and the krishna which also drain into the bay of bengal and the narmada and the tapti which drain into the arabian sea indias coastline measures  kilometres  mi in length of this distance  kilometres  mi belong to peninsular india and  kilometres  mi to the andaman nicobar and lakshadweep island chains according to the indian naval hydrographic charts the mainland coastline consists of the following  sandy beaches  rocky shores including cliffs and  mudflats or marshy shores coastal features include the marshy rann of kutch of western india and the alluvial sundarbans delta of eastern india the latter is shared with bangladesh india has two archipelagos the lakshadweep coral atolls off indias southwestern coast and the andaman and nicobar islands a volcanic chain in the andaman sea climate the indian climate is strongly influenced by the himalayas and the thar desert both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons the himalayas prevent cold central asian katabatic winds from blowing in keeping the bulk of the indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes the thar desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moistureladen southwest summer monsoon winds that between june and october provide the majority of indias rainfall four major climatic groupings predominate in india tropical wet tropical dry subtropical humid and montane temperatures in india have risen by  c  f between  and  climate change in india is often thought to be the cause the retreat of himalayan glaciers has adversely affected the flow rate of the major himalayan rivers including the ganges and the brahmaputra according to some current projections the number and severity of droughts in india will have markedly increased by the end of the present century biodiversity india is a megadiverse country a term employed for  countries that display high biological diversity and contain many species exclusively indigenous or endemic to them india is the habitat for  of all mammals  of bird species  of reptile species  of amphibian species  of fish species and  of all flowering plant species fully a third of indian plant species are endemic india also contains four of the worlds  biodiversity hotspots or regions that display significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemism indias most dense forests such as the tropical moist forest of the andaman islands the western ghats and northeast india occupy approximately  of its land area moderately dense forest whose canopy density is between  and  occupies  of indias land area it predominates in the temperate coniferous forest of the himalayas the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern india and the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern india india has two natural zones of thorn forest one in the deccan plateau immediately east of the western ghats and the other in the western part of the indogangetic plain now turned into rich agricultural land by irrigation its features no longer visible among the indian subcontinents notable indigenous trees are the astringent azadirachta indica or neem which is widely used in rural indian herbal medicine and the luxuriant ficus religiosa or peepul which is displayed on the ancient seals of mohenjodaro and under which the buddha is recorded in the pali canon to have sought enlightenment many indian species have descended from those of gondwana the southern supercontinent from which india separated more than  million years ago indias subsequent collision with eurasia set off a mass exchange of species however volcanism and climatic changes later caused the extinction of many endemic indian forms still later mammals entered india from asia through two zoogeographic passes flanking the himalayas this lowered endemism among indias mammals which stands at  contrasting with  among reptiles and  among amphibians among endemics are the vulnerable hooded leaf monkey and the threatened beddomes toad of the western ghats india contains  iucndesignated threatened animal species or  of endangered forms these include the endangered bengal tiger and the ganges river dolphin critically endangered species include the gharial a crocodilian the great indian bustard and the indian whiterumped vulture which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenactreated cattle before they were extensively used for agriculture and cleared for human settlement the thorn forests of punjab were mingled at intervals with open grasslands that were grazed by large herds of blackbuck preyed on by the asiatic cheetah the blackbuck no longer extant in punjab is now severely endangered in india and the cheetah is extinct the pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered indian wildlife in response the system of national parks and protected areas first established in  was expanded substantially in  india enacted the wildlife protection act and project tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness the forest conservation act was enacted in  and amendments added in  india hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and eighteen biosphere reserves four of which are part of the world network of biosphere reserves its eightynine wetlands are registered under the ramsar convention government and politics politics india is a parliamentary republic with a multiparty system there are six recognised national parties in the country including the indian national congress generally the congress and the bharatiya janata

indias recent history the number of people living in urban areas grew by  between  and  in  over  lived in rural areas the level of urbanisation increased further from  in the  census to  in the

indias federal government was chosen by the constituent assembly of india in september  after three years of debate between two opposing camps hindi language protagonists wanted hindi in the devanagari script to be the sole national language of india whereas delegates from south india preferred english to have a place in the constitution the compromise reached declared i hindi to be the official language of indias federal government ii english to be an associate official language for  years during which hindis formal lexicon would be developed and iii the international form of hinduarabic numerals to be the official numerals the compromise resolution became articles  of indias constitution which came into effect on  january  in  when the  years were up the government of india announced that english would continue to be the de facto formal language of india the eighth schedule of indias constitution also recognises  languages including hindi but not english which the

religion in india is characterised by a diversity of beliefs and practices throughout indias history religion has been an important part of its culture the indian subcontinent is the birthplace of four major world religions buddhism hinduism jainism and sikhism india has the largest population of hindus sikhs and jains the thirdlargest population of muslims after indonesia and pakistan and the ninth largest of buddhists india also has the largest population of people adhering to both zoroastrianism parsis and iranis and the bahai faith the preamble to the constitution of india declares

urban areas kerala is the most literate state with  literacy while bihar the least with  in  the respective literacy rates for total population men and women were   and  in  the rates were   and  in  the rates   and  in  they were   and  according to latika chaudhary in  there were under three primary schools for every ten villages statistically more caste and religious diversity reduced private spending primary schools taught literacy so local diversity limited its growth the education system of india is the worlds secondlargest india has over  universities  colleges and  million schools in indias higher education system a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the historically disadvantaged in recent decades indias improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development health india bears a disproportionately large burden of the worlds tuberculosis rates with world health organization who statistics for  estimating  million new infections annually accounting for  of the global total it is estimated that approximately  of the population of india carry tuberculosis infection in  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was the leading cause of death after heart disease the  most polluted cities in the world are all in india with more than  million people breathing air  times or more over the who safe limit in  air pollution killed  million indians culture society although sometimes applied to other cultures and religions caste is a uniquely indian and hindu social institution all hindus fall broadly into four castes or varnas brahmin or priests at the top below them kshatriya or warriors further below vaishya or merchants and farmers and at the bottom shudra or the service class outside the caste system and therefore of traditional hinduism lie people formerly called outcastes or untouchables and now scheduled caste a term used in indias constitution or dalit a later selfdescription of pride meaning broken or downtrodden each caste is further divided into subcastes or jatis many of which are tied to occupations the custom of endogamy or marrying within ones subcaste however makes caste a hereditary label not of one occupational choice and has caused the caste system therefore to become entrenched the constituent assembly of india abolished untouchability in  the republic of india did more formally in  and india has since enacted other antidiscriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives related to caste still castebased inequality discrimination segregation and violence persist multigenerational patrilineal joint families have been the norm in india though nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas a very large majority of indians have their marriages arranged by their parents or family elders marriage is thought to be for life and the divorce rate is extremely low less than one in a thousand marriages end in divorce many women marry before reaching  which is their legal marriageable age child marriages are not uncommon especially in rural areas in large parts of hindu northern india moreover a form of territorial exogamy is observed in which a bride marries out of her natal village and her parents do not visit her in her married home the annual rite raksha bandhan during which married women return to their natal homes has served both to affirm bonds with their natal families and offer a recourse in times of marital stress visual art india has a very ancient tradition of art which has exchanged many influences with the rest of eurasia especially in the first millennium during this period buddhist art spread with indian religions to central east and southeast asia the last also greatly influenced by hindu art thousands of seals from the indus valley civilisation of the third millennium bce have been found usually carved with animals but also some with human figures the pashupati seal excavated in mohenjodaro pakistan in  is the best known virtually no art survives from a long period following the indus valley civilisation almost all surviving ancient indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious sculpture in durable materials or coins there was probably originally far more in wood which is lost in north india mauryan art is the first imperial movement over the following centuries a distinctly indian style of sculpting the human figure developed with less interest in articulating precise anatomy than ancient greek sculpture but showing smoothly flowing forms expressing prana breath or lifeforce this is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or heads or represent different genders on the left and right of figures as with the ardhanarishvara form of shiva and parvati most of the earliest large sculpture is buddhist either excavated from buddhist stupas such as sanchi sarnath and amaravati or is rock cut reliefs at sites such as ajanta karla and ellora hindu and jain sites appear rather later in spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions generally the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups and sculptors probably usually served all communities gupta art at its peak c  ce  c  ce is often regarded as a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after it saw a new dominance of hindu sculpture as at the elephanta caves across the north this became rather stiff and formulaic after c  ce though rich with finely carved detail in the surrounds of statues but in the south under the pallava and chola dynasties sculpture in both stone and bronze had a sustained period of great achievement the large bronzes with shiva as nataraja have become an iconic symbol of india ancient paintings have only survived at a few sites of which the crowded scenes of court life in the ajanta caves are some of the most important painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from eastern india from th century onwards most of the earliest being buddhist and later jain these significantly influenced later artistic styles the persianderived deccan painting starting just before the mughal miniature between them give the first large body of secular painting with an emphasis on portraits and the recording of princely pleasures and wars the style spread to hindu courts especially among the rajputs and developed a variety of styles with the smaller courts often the most innovative with figures such as nihal chand and nainsukh as a market developed among european residents it was supplied by company painting by indian artists with considerable western influence in the th century cheap kalighat paintings of gods and everyday life done on paper were urban folk art from calcutta which later saw the bengal school of art reflecting the art colleges founded by the british the first movement in modern indian painting mathematics significant mathematics began in india in the first millennium bce the sulba sutras literally aphorisms of the chords in vedic sanskrit c  bce contain the earliest extant verbal expression of the pythagorean theorem although very likely it had been known to the old babylonians all mathematical works were orally transmitted until approximately  bce thereafter they were transmitted both orally and in manuscript form the oldest extant mathematical document produced on the indian subcontinent is the birch bark bakhshali manuscript from the th century ce in the classical period of indian mathematics  ce to  ce important contributions were made by aryabhata brahmagupta bhaskara ii varahamihira and madhava the decimal number system in use today was first recorded in indian mathematics indian mathematicians made early contributions to the study of the concept of zero as a number negative numbers arithmetic and algebra trigonometry was further advanced in india and the modern definitions of sine and cosine were developed there these mathematical concepts were transmitted to the middle east china and europe a later landmark in indian mathematics was the development of the series expansions for trigonometric functions sine cosine and arc tangent by mathematicians of the kerala school in the th century ce their work completed two centuries before the invention of calculus in europe provided the first example of a power series in the modern era srinivasa ramanujan made fundamental contributions to number theory music india contains a wide array of musical practices including many different folk musics from different regions indian classical music has vedic origins and split in the th century into the two main traditions of hindustani and carnatic music hindustani is associated with north india and is more improvisational featuring instruments such as the sitar and tabla and carnatic is south indian and more focused on written compositions such as the kriti while both styles contain common elements such as the raga melodic framework and tala rhythmic meter indian music has influenced western genres notably rock and jazz musicians during the s counterculture filmi is music written for indian cinema generally composed by music directors and sung by playback singers modern indian pop takes influences from classical folk and western pop music dance dance in india has drawn heavily from indian classical dance traditions many of these in turn arose in temples or other religious contexts their sponsorship and promotion however has continued in secular modern india india also has local and modern dance traditions whether or not a dance is classical is determined by the sangeet natak academi the indian governments organisation for performing arts although more dances could perhaps meet the criteria for classical the akademi has chosen eight the bestknown classical dance is bharatnatyam which began in the temple dances of tamil devadasis identified with prostitutes and courtesans their dancing was formally banned in  concurrently the dance was rehabilitated as a pure art form with rukmini devi arundale as a prominent figure a devdasi who went on to attain national and international prominence was thanjavur balasaraswati some sources consider the dancedramas chhau of jharkhand west bengal and odissa and yakshagana of karnataka to also belong to the classical tradition local dance traditions vary widely across india in addition to the dancedramas chhau and yakshagana they include dancedramas raslila of western uttar pradesh and terukkuttu of tamil nadu calendrical and festival dances such as the bhangra of punjab especially at vaisakhi the onset of spring and garba of gujarat during navratri and tribal or adivasi dances such as those of the santal and toda people the latter for example in honour of the god on who brought buffalo to earth among thcentury directions is the modern dance of uday shankar in which classical styles were employed but not adhered to rigidly examples are dancedramas based on the ancient indian animal fables panchatantra and nehrus midcentury meditation on indian history the discovery of india dance has been an essential aspect of indian films from the first talkies of the s the individual and group dances of bollywood for example show a broad range of influences including classical local and western popular dance towards the end of the th century innovations in british south asian music and dance such as postbhangra fed back into dance in india clothing from ancient times until the advent of the modern the most widely worn traditional dress in india was draped for women it took the form of a sari a single piece of cloth many yards long the sari was traditionally wrapped around the lower body and the shoulder in its modern form it is combined with an underskirt or indian petticoat and tucked in along the waist band for more secure fastening it is also commonly worn with an indian blouse or choli which serves as the primary upperbody garment the saris endpassing over the shouldercovering the midriff and obscuring the upper bodys contours for men a similar but shorter length of cloth the dhoti has served as a lowerbody garment the use of stitched clothes became widespread after muslim rule was established by the delhi sultanate c  ce and continued by the mughal empire c  ce among the garments introduced during this time and still commonly worn are the shalwars and pyjamas both styles of trousers and the tunics kurta and kameez shalwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom they are held up by a drawstring which causes them to become pleated around the waist when the pants are cut quite narrow on the bias they are called churidars the kameez is a long shirt or tunic its side seams left open below the waistline the kurta is traditionally collarless and made of cotton or silk it is worn plain or with embroidered decoration such as chikankari and typically falls to either just above or just below the wearers knees in the last  years fashions have changed a great deal in india increasingly in urban northern india the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear though they remain popular on formal occasions the traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn by younger urban women who favour churidars or jeans in office settings ubiquitous air conditioning allows men to wear sports jackets yearround for weddings and formal occasions men in the middle and upper classes often wear bandhgala or short nehru jackets with pants with the groom and his groomsmen sporting sherwanis and churidars cuisine the foundation of a typical indian meal is a cereal cooked plainly and complemented with savoury dishes the cooked cereal could be steamed rice chapati a thin unleavened bread idli a steamed breakfast cake or dosa a griddled pancake the savoury dishes might include lentils pulses vegetables meat poultry and fish commonly spiced with ginger and garlic but also coriander cumin turmeric cinnamon cardamon and others in some instances the ingredients may be mixed during the cooking process india has distinctive vegetarian cuisines each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents about  to  of indias population consists of vegetarians although meat is eaten widely the proportional consumption of meat is low the most significant import of cooking techniques into india during the last millennium occurred during the mughal empire spreading into northern india from regions to its northwest along with dishes such as pilaf onions garlic almonds and spices were added to the simple yogurt marinade of persia rice was partially cooked and layered alternately with sauteed meat the pot sealed tightly and slow cooked according to another persian cooking technique to produce biryani a feature of festive dining in many parts of india the diversity of indian food served worldwide has been partially concealed by the dominance of punjabi cuisine the popularity of tandoori chickencooked in a tandoor oven which had traditionally been used for baking bread in the rural punjab and the delhi region especially among muslims but which is originally from central asiadates to the s and was caused in large part by an entrepreneurial response among people from the punjab who had been displaced by the  partition sports several traditional indigenous sports such as kabaddi kho kho pehlwani and gillidanda and also martial arts such as kalarippayattu and marma adi remain popular chess is commonly held to have originated in india as chaturanga there has been a rise in the number of indian grandmasters viswanathan anand became the undisputed chess world champion in  and held the status until  parcheesi is derived from pachisi another traditional indian pastime which in early modern times was played on a giant marble court by mughal emperor akbar
