through the coral islands searching for help when they encountered an englishspeaking native with a canoe kennedy carved his location on a coconut shell and requested a boat rescue seven days after the collision with the coconut message delivered the pt crew was rescued almost immediately the pt rescue became a highly publicized event the story was chronicled by john hersey in the new yorker in  decades later it was the basis of a successful film it followed kennedy into politics and provided a strong foundation for his appeal as a leader hersey portrayed kennedy as a modest selfdeprecating hero for his courage and leadership kennedy was awarded the navy and marine corps medal and the injuries he suffered during the incident qualified him for a purple heart after a months recovery kennedy returned to duty commanding pt on november  kennedys pt along with two other pt boats took part in the rescue of  to  marines the  acted as a shield from shore fire as they escaped on two

never recovered news of his death reached the familys home in hyannis port massachusetts a day later kennedy felt that joe jrs reckless flight was partly an effort to outdo him to console himself kennedy set out to assemble a privately published book of remembrances of his brother as we remember joe journalism  in april  kennedys father who was a friend of william randolph hearst arranged a position for his son as a special correspondent for hearst newspapers the assignment kept kennedys name in the public eye and exposed him to journalism as a possible career he covered the united nations conference on international organization in san francisco the british elections and the potsdam conference in germany us house of representatives  kennedys elder brother joe jr had been the familys political standardbearer and was tapped by their father to seek the presidency after joes death the assignment fell to john as the second eldest boston mayor maurice j tobin discussed the possibility of john becoming his running mate in  as a candidate for massachusetts lieutenant governor but joe sr preferred a congressional campaign that could send john to washington where he could have national visibility at the urging of joe sr us representative james michael curley vacated his seat in the solidly democratic th congressional district of massachusetts to become mayor of boston in  kennedy established legal residency at  bowdoin street across from the massachusetts state house he won the democratic primary with  percent of the vote defeating nine other candidates according to fredrik logevall joe sr spent hours on the phone with reporters and editors seeking information trading confidences and cajoling them into publishing puff pieces on john ones that invariably played up his war record in the pacific he oversaw a professional advertising campaign that ensured ads went up in just the right places the campaign had a virtual monopoly on boston subway space and on window stickers kennedy for congress for cars and homes and was the force behind the mass mailing of herseys pt article though republicans took control of the house in the  elections kennedy defeated his republican opponent in the general election taking  percent of the vote as a congressman kennedy had a reputation for taking little interest in the management of his office or his constituents concerns with one of the highest absenteeism rates in the house although much was explained by illness george smathers one of his few political friends at the time claimed that he was more interested in being a writer than a politician and at that time he suffered from extreme shyness kennedy found most of his fellow congressmen boring preoccupied as they all seemed to be with their narrow political concerns the arcane house rules and customs which slowed legislation exasperated him kennedy served in the house for six years joining the influential education and labor committee and the veterans affairs committee he concentrated his attention on international affairs supporting the truman doctrine as an appropriate response to the emerging cold war he also supported public housing and opposed the labor management relations act of  which restricted the power of labor unions though not as vocally anticommunist as joseph mccarthy kennedy supported the internal security act of  which required communists to register with the government and he deplored the loss of china kennedy denounced truman and the state department during a speech in salem massachusetts on january   for contributing to the tragic story of china whose freedom we once fought to preserve what our young men had saved in world war ii our diplomats and our president have frittered away having served as a boy scout during his childhood kennedy was active in the boston council from  to  as district vice chairman member of the executive board vicepresident and national council representative to appeal to the large italianamerican voting bloc in massachusetts kennedy delivered a speech in november  supporting a  million aid package to italy he maintained that italy was in danger from an onslaught of the communist minority and that the country was the initial battleground in the communist drive to capture western europe to counter soviet efforts to take control in middle eastern and asian countries like indochina kennedy wanted the united states to develop nonmilitary techniques of resistance that would not create suspicions of neoimperialism or add to the countrys financial burden the problem as he saw it was not simply to be anticommunist but to stand for something that these emerging nations would find appealing almost every weekend that congress was in session kennedy would fly back to massachusetts to give speeches to veteran fraternal and civic groups while maintaining an index card file on individuals who might be helpful in a future statewide campaign contemplating whether to run for massachusetts governor or the us senate kennedy abandoned interest in the former believing that the governor sat in an office handing out sewer contracts us senate  as early as  kennedy began preparing to run for the senate in  against republican threeterm incumbent henry cabot lodge jr with the campaign slogan kennedy will do more for massachusetts joe sr again financed his sons candidacypersuading the boston post to switch its support to kennedy by promising the publisher a  loanwhile johns younger brother robert emerged as campaign manager kennedys mother and sisters were also highly effective canvassers hosting a series of teas at hotels and parlors across massachusetts to reach out to women voters in the presidential election republican dwight d eisenhower carried massachusetts by  votes but kennedy narrowly defeated lodge by  votes for the senate seat the following year he married jacqueline bouvier kennedy underwent several spinal operations over the next two years often absent from the senate he was at times critically ill and received catholic last rites during his convalescence in  he published profiles in courage a book about us senators who risked their careers for their personal beliefs for which he won the pulitzer prize for biography in  rumors that this work was ghostwritten by his close adviser and speechwriter ted sorensen were confirmed in sorensens  autobiography at the start of his first term kennedy focused on fulfilling the promise of his campaign to do more for massachusetts than his predecessor although kennedys and lodges legislative records were similarly liberal lodge voted for the tafthartley act of  and kennedy voted against it on nbcs meet the press kennedy excoriated lodge for not doing enough to prevent the increasing migration of manufacturing jobs from massachusetts to the south and blamed the righttowork provision for giving the south an unfair advantage over massachusetts in labor costs in may  kennedy introduced the economic problems of new england a point program to help massachusetts industries such as fishing textile manufacturing watchmaking and shipbuilding as well as the boston seaport kennedys policy agenda included protective tariffs preventing excessive speculation in raw wool stronger efforts to research and market american fish products an increase in the fish and wildlife service budget including funds for us fws albatross iii funds to rehabilitate the south boston army base shipbuilding contracts at the fore river shipyard in quincy massachusetts and the development of hydroelectric and nuclear power in new englandsuch as the yankee rowe nuclear power station in rowe massachusetts which began construction in  kennedys suggestions for stimulating the regions economy appealed to both parties by offering benefits to business and labor and promising to serve national defense congress would eventually enact most of the program a massachusetts audubon society supporter kennedy wanted to make sure that the shorelines of cape cod remained unsullied by industrialization on september   kennedy cosponsored the cape cod national seashore bill with his republican colleague senator leverett saltonstall as a senator kennedy quickly won a reputation for responsiveness to requests from constituents ie cosponsoring legislation to provide federal loans to help rebuild communities damaged by the  worcester tornado except on certain occasions when the national interest was at stake in  kennedy voted in favor of the saint lawrence seaway which would connect the great lakes to the atlantic ocean despite opposition from massachusetts politicians who argued that the project would hurt the port of boston economically in  when the senate voted to condemn joseph mccarthy for breaking senate rules and abusing an army general kennedy was the only democrat not to cast a vote against him kennedy drafted a speech supporting the censure however it was not delivered because kennedy was hospitalized for back surgery in boston although kennedy never indicated how he would have voted the episode damaged his support among members of the liberal community in the  and  elections in  kennedy gained control of the massachusetts democratic party and delivered the state delegation to the partys presidential nominee adlai stevenson ii at the democratic national convention in august stevenson let the convention select the vice presidential nominee kennedy finished second in the balloting losing to senator estes kefauver of tennessee but receiving national exposure in  kennedy joined the senates select committee on labor rackets also known as the mcclellan committee with his brother robert who was chief counsel to investigate racketeering in labormanagement relations the hearings attracted extensive radio and television coverage where the kennedy brothers engaged in dramatic arguments with controversial labor leaders including jimmy hoffa of the teamsters union the following year kennedy introduced a bill to prevent the expenditure of union dues for improper purposes or private gain to forbid loans from union funds for illicit transactions and to compel audits of unions which would ensure against false financial reports it was the first major labor relations bill to pass either house since the tafthartley act of  and dealt largely with the control of union abuses exposed by the mcclellan committee but did not incorporate tough tafthartley amendments requested by president eisenhower it survived senate floor attempts to include tafthartley amendments and passed but was rejected by the house honest union members and the general public can only regard it as a tragedy that politics has prevented the recommendations of the mcclellan committee from being carried out this year kennedy announced that same year kennedy joined the senates foreign relations committee there he supported algerias effort to gain independence from france and sponsored an amendment to the mutual defense assistance act that would provide aid to soviet satellite nations kennedy in  introduced a controversial bill to eliminate from the national defense education act of  a provision requiring loyalty oaths and affidavits from aid recipients kennedy cast a procedural vote against president eisenhowers bill for the civil rights act of  and this was considered by some to be an appeasement of southern democratic opponents of the bill kennedy did vote for title iii of the act which would have given the attorney general powers to enjoin but majority leader lyndon b johnson agreed to let the provision die as a compromise measure kennedy also voted for the jury trial amendment many civil rights advocates criticized the vote as one that would weaken the act a final compromise bill which kennedy supported was passed in september  as a senator from massachusetts which lacked a sizable black population kennedy was not particularly sensitive to the problems of african americans robert kennedy later reflected we werent thinking of the negroes of mississippi or alabamawhat should be done for them we were thinking of what needed to be done in massachusetts most historians and political scientists who have written about kennedy refer to his us senate years as an interlude according to historian robert dallek kennedy called being a senator the most corrupting job in the world he complained that they were all too quick to cut deals and please campaign contributors to ensure their political futures kennedy with the luxury of a rich father who could finance his campaigns could remain independent of any special interest except for those in his home state of massachusetts that could align against his reelection according to author robert caro majority leader lyndon johnson viewed kennedy as a playboy describing his performance in the senate and the house as pathetic on another occasion saying that he was smart enough but he doesnt like the grunt work author john t shaw acknowledges that while his senate career is not associated with acts of historic statesmanship or novel political thought kennedy made modest contributions as a legislator drafting more than  bills to benefit massachusetts and the new england region some of which became law in  kennedy was reelected to the senate defeating his republican opponent boston lawyer vincent j celeste with  percent of the vote the largest winning margin in the history of massachusetts politics in the aftermath of his reelection kennedy began preparing to run for president by traveling throughout the us to build his candidacy for   presidential election on january   kennedy announced his candidacy for the democratic presidential nomination though some questioned kennedys age and experience his charisma and eloquence earned him numerous supporters kennedy faced several potential challengers including senate majority leader lyndon johnson adlai stevenson ii and senator hubert humphrey kennedy traveled extensively to build his support his campaign strategy was to win several primaries to demonstrate his electability to the party bosses who controlled most of the delegates and to prove to his detractors that a catholic could win popular support victories over senator humphrey in the wisconsin and west virginia primaries gave kennedy momentum as he moved on to the  democratic national convention in los angeles when kennedy entered the convention he had the most delegates but not enough to ensure that he would win the nomination stevensonthe  and  presidential nomineeremained very popular while johnson also hoped to win the nomination with support from party leaders kennedys candidacy also faced opposition from former president harry s truman who was concerned about kennedys lack of experience kennedy knew that a second ballot could give the nomination to johnson or someone else and his wellorganized campaign was able to earn the support of just enough delegates to win the presidential nomination on the first ballot kennedy ignored the opposition of his brother robert who wanted him to choose labor leader walter reuther and other liberal supporters when he chose johnson as his vicepresidential nominee he believed that the texas senator could help him win support from the south in accepting the presidential nomination kennedy gave his wellknown new frontier speech for the problems are not all solved and the battles are not all wonand we stand today on the edge of a new frontier  but the new frontier of which i speak is not a set of promisesit is a set of challenges it sums up not what i intend to offer the american people but what i intend to ask of them at the start of the fall general election campaign the republican nominee and incumbent vice president richard nixon held a sixpoint lead in the polls major issues included how to get the economy moving again kennedys catholicism the cuban revolution and whether the space and missile programs of the soviet union had surpassed those of the us to address fears that his catholic faith would impact his decisionmaking he told the greater houston ministerial association on september  i am not the catholic candidate for president i am the democratic party candidate for president who also happens to be a catholic i do not speak for my church on public mattersand the church does not speak for me he promised to respect the separation of church and state and not to allow catholic officials to dictate public policy the kennedy and nixon campaigns agreed to a series of televised debates an estimated  million americans about twothirds of the electorate watched the first debate on september  kennedy had met the day before with the producer to discuss the set design and camera placement nixon recently released from the hospital after a painful knee injury did not take advantage of this opportunity and during the debate looked at the reporters asking questions and not at the camera kennedy wore a blue suit and shirt to reduce glare and appeared sharply focused against the gray studio background nixon wore a lightcolored suit that blended into the gray background in combination with the harsh studio lighting that left nixon perspiring he offered a lessthancommanding presence by contrast kennedy appeared relaxed tanned and telegenic looking into the camera while answering questions it is often claimed that television viewers overwhelmingly believed kennedy appearing to be the more attractive of the two had won while radio listeners a smaller audience thought nixon had defeated him however only one poll split tv and radio voters like this and the methodology was poor pollster elmo roper concluded that the debates raised interest boosted turnout and gave kennedy an estimated two million additional votes largely due to the first debate the debates are now considered a milestone in american political historythe point at which the medium of television began to play a dominant role kennedys campaign gained momentum after the first debate and he pulled slightly ahead of nixon in most polls on election day kennedy defeated nixon in one of the closest presidential elections of the th century in the national popular vote by most accounts kennedy led nixon by just twotenths of one percent  to  while in the electoral college he won  votes to nixons   were needed to win fourteen electors from mississippi and alabama refused to support kennedy because he supported the civil rights movement they voted for senator harry f byrd of virginia as did an elector from oklahoma fortythree years old kennedy was the youngest person ever elected to the presidency though theodore roosevelt was a year younger when he succeeded to the presidency after the assassination of william mckinley in  presidency  kennedy was sworn in as the th president at noon on january   in his inaugural address he spoke of the need for all americans to be active citizens ask not what your country can do for youask what you can do for your country he asked the nations of the world to join to fight what he called the common enemies of man tyranny poverty disease and war itself he added all this will not be finished in the first one hundred days nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days nor in the life of this administration nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet but let us begin in closing he expanded on his desire for greater internationalism finally whether you are citizens of america or citizens of the world ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you the address reflected kennedys confidence that his administration would chart a historically significant course in both domestic policy and foreign affairs the contrast between this optimistic vision and the pressures of managing daily political realities would be one of the main tensions of the early years of his administration kennedy scrapped the decisionmaking structure of eisenhower favoring an organizational model resembling a wheel with all spokes leading to the president he was willing to make the increased number of rapid decisions required in such an environment though the cabinet remained important kennedy generally relied more on his staffers within the executive office despite concerns over nepotism kennedys father insisted that robert kennedy become us attorney general and the younger kennedy became the assistant president who advised on all major issues foreign policy cold war and flexible response kennedys foreign policy was dominated by american confrontations with the soviet union manifested by proxy contests in the global state of tension known as the cold war like his predecessors kennedy adopted the policy of containment to stop the spread of communism fearful of the possibility of nuclear war kennedy implemented a defense strategy known as flexible response this strategy relied on multiple options for responding to the soviet union discouraged massive retaliation and encouraged mutual deterrence in contrast to eisenhowers warning about the perils of the militaryindustrial complex kennedy focused on rearmament from  to  the number of nuclear weapons increased by  percent as did the number of b bombers to deliver them in january  soviet premier nikita khrushchev declared his support for wars of national liberation kennedy interpreted this step as a direct threat to the free world decolonization and the congo crisis between  and  twentyfour countries gained independence as the process of decolonization continued kennedy set out to woo the leaders and people of the third world expanding economic aid and appointing knowledgeable ambassadors his administration established the food for peace program and the peace corps to provide aid to developing countries the food for peace program became a central element in american foreign policy and eventually helped many countries to develop their economies and become commercial import customers during the election campaign kennedy attacked the eisenhower administration for losing ground on the african continent and stressed that the us should be on the side of anticolonialism and selfdetermination kennedy considered the congo crisis to be among the most important foreign policy issues facing his presidency and he supported a un operation that prevented the secession of katanga moise tshombe leader of katanga declared its independence from the congo and the soviet union responded by sending weapons and technicians to underwrite their struggle on october   kennedy signed the united nations bond issue bill to ensure us assistance in financing un peacekeeping operations in the congo and elsewhere peace corps in one of his first presidential acts kennedy signed executive order  that officially started the peace corps he named his brotherinlaw sargent shriver as its first director through this program americans volunteered to help developing countries in fields like education farming health care and construction kennedy believed that countries that received peace corps volunteers were less likely to succumb to a communist revolution tanganyika presentday tanzania and ghana were the first countries to participate the organization grew to  members by march  and  the year after since  over  americans have joined the peace corps representing  countries vienna summit and the berlin wall kennedy anxiously anticipated a summit with nikita khrushchev the proceedings for the summit got off to a problematic start when kennedy reacted aggressively to a routine khrushchev speech on cold war confrontation in early  the speech was intended for domestic audiences in the soviet union but kennedy interpreted it as a personal challenge his mistake helped raise tensions going into the vienna summit the summit would cover several topics but both leaders knew that the most contentious issue would be berlin which had been divided in two with the start of the cold war the enclave of west berlin lay within sovietallied east germany but was supported by the us and other western powers the soviets wanted to reunify berlin under the control of east germany partly due to the large number of east germans who had fled to west berlin on june   kennedy met with khrushchev in vienna and left the meeting angry and disappointed that he had allowed the premier to bully him despite the warnings he had received khrushchev for his part was impressed with the presidents intelligence but thought him weak kennedy did succeed in conveying the bottom line to khrushchev on the most sensitive issue before them a proposed treaty between moscow and east berlin he made it clear that any treaty interfering with us access rights in west berlin would be regarded as an act of war shortly after kennedy returned home the soviet union announced its plan to sign a treaty with east berlin abrogating any thirdparty occupation rights in either sector of the city kennedy assumed that his only option was to prepare the country for nuclear war which he thought had a oneinfive chance of occurring in the weeks immediately following the summit more than  people fled from east berlin to the western sector reacting to statements from the soviet union kennedy began intensive meetings on the berlin issue where dean acheson took the lead in recommending a military buildup alongside nato allies in a july  speech kennedy announced his decision to add  billion equivalent to  billion in  to the defense budget along with over  additional troops stating that an attack on west berlin would be taken as an attack on the us the speech received an  approval rating a month later both the soviet union and east berlin began blocking any further passage of east germans into west berlin and erected barbedwire fences which were quickly upgraded to the berlin wall kennedy acquiesced to the wall though he sent vice president johnson to west berlin to reaffirm us commitment to the enclaves defense in the following months in a sign of rising cold war tensions both the us and the soviet union ended a moratorium on nuclear weapon testing a brief standoff between us and soviet tanks occurred at checkpoint charlie in october following a dispute over free movement of allied personnel the crisis was defused largely through a backchannel communication the kennedy administration had set up with soviet spy georgi bolshakov in remarks to his aides on the berlin wall kennedy noted that its not a very nice solution but a wall is a hell of a lot better than a war bay of pigs invasion the eisenhower administration had created a plan to overthrow fidel castros regime though an invasion of cuba by a counterrevolutionary insurgency composed of ustrained anticastro cuban exiles led by cia paramilitary officers kennedy had campaigned on a hardline stance against castro and when presented with the plan that had been developed under the eisenhower administration he enthusiastically adopted it regardless of the risk of inflaming tensions with the soviet union kennedy approved the final invasion plan on april   on april   eight ciasupplied b bombers left nicaragua to bomb cuban airfields the bombers missed many of their targets leaving most of castros air force intact on april  the  ustrained cuban exile invasion force known as brigade  landed at beaches along the bay of pigs and immediately came under heavy fire the goal was to spark a widespread popular uprising against castro but no such uprising occurred no us air support was provided the invading force was defeated within two days by the cuban revolutionary armed forces  were killed and kennedy was forced to negotiate for the release of the  survivors after twenty months cuba released the captured exiles in exchange for a ransom of  million worth of food and medicine the incident made castro wary of the us and led him to believe that another invasion would take place biographer richard reeves said that kennedy focused primarily on the political repercussions of the plan rather than military considerations when it proved unsuccessful he was convinced that the plan was a setup to make him look bad he took responsibility for the failure saying we got a big kick in the leg and we deserved it but maybe well learn something from it kennedys approval ratings climbed afterwards helped in part by the vocal support given to him by nixon and eisenhower he appointed robert kennedy to help lead a committee to examine the causes of the failure the kennedy administration banned all cuban imports and convinced the organization of american states oas to expel cuba operation mongoose in late  the white house formed the special group augmented headed by robert kennedy and including edward lansdale secretary robert mcnamara and others the groups objectiveto overthrow castro via espionage sabotage and other covert tacticswas never pursued in november  he authorized operation mongoose in march  kennedy rejected operation northwoods proposals for false flag attacks against american military and civilian targets and blaming them on the cuban government to gain approval for a war against cuba however the administration continued to plan for an invasion of cuba in the summer of  cuban missile crisis in the aftermath of the bay of pigs invasion khrushchev increased economic and military assistance to cuba the soviet union planned to allocate in cuba  mediumrange ballistic missiles  intermediaterange ballistic missiles  light il bombers and about  tactical nuclear weapons the kennedy administration viewed the growing cubasoviet alliance with alarm fearing that it could eventually pose a threat to the us on october   cia u spy planes took photographs of the soviets construction of intermediaterange ballistic missile sites in cuba the photos were shown to kennedy on october  a consensus was reached that the missiles were offensive in nature and posed an immediate nuclear threat kennedy faced a dilemma if the us attacked the sites it might lead to nuclear war with the soviet union but if the us did nothing it would be faced with the increased threat from closerange nuclear weapons positioned approximately  mi  km away from the florida coast the us would also appear to the world as less committed to the defense of the western hemisphere on a personal level kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to khrushchev especially after the vienna summit to deal with the crisis he formed an adhoc body of key advisers later known as excomm that met secretly between october  and  more than a third of us national security council nsc members favored an unannounced air assault on the missile sites but some saw this as pearl harbor in reverse there was some concern from the international community asked in confidence that the assault plan was an overreaction given that eisenhower had placed pgm jupiter missiles in italy and turkey in  it also could not be assured that the assault would be  effective in concurrence with a majority vote of the nsc kennedy decided on a naval blockade or quarantine on october  after privately informing the cabinet and leading members of congress about the situation kennedy announced the naval blockade on national television and warned that us forces would seize offensive weapons and associated materiel that soviet vessels might attempt to deliver to cuba the us navy would stop and inspect all soviet ships arriving off cuba beginning october  several soviet ships approached the blockade line but they stopped or reversed course the oas gave unanimous support to the removal of the missiles kennedy exchanged two sets of letters with khrushchev to no avail un secretary general u thant requested both parties to reverse their decisions and enter a coolingoff period khrushchev agreed but kennedy did not kennedy managed to preserve restraint when a soviet missile unauthorizedly downed a us lockheed u reconnaissance aircraft over cuba killing pilot rudolf anderson at the presidents direction robert kennedy privately informed soviet ambassador anatoly dobrynin that the us would remove the jupiter missiles from turkey within a short time after this crisis was over on october  khrushchev agreed to dismantle the missile sites subject to un inspections the us publicly promised never to invade cuba and privately agreed to remove its jupiter missiles from italy and turkey which were by then obsolete and had been supplanted by submarines equipped with ugm polaris missiles in the aftermath a moscowwashington hotline was established to ensure clear communications between the leaders of the two countries this crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or after but the humanity of khrushchev and kennedy prevailed the crisis improved the image of american willpower and the presidents credibility kennedys approval rating increased from  to  immediately thereafter latin america and communism believing that those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable kennedy sought to contain the perceived threat of communism in latin america by establishing the alliance for progress which sent aid to some countries and sought greater human rights standards in the region in response to kennedys plea congress voted for an initial grant of  million in may  the alliance for progress supported the construction of housing schools airports hospitals clinics and waterpurification projects as well as the distribution of free textbooks to students however the program did not meet many of its goals massive land reform was not achieved populations more than kept pace with gains in health and welfare and according to one study only  percent of economic growth in s latin america directly benefited the poor us presidents after kennedy were less supportive of the program and by  the permanent committee established to implement the alliance was disbanded by the oas the eisenhower administration through the cia had begun formulating plans to assassinate castro in cuba and rafael trujillo in the dominican republic when kennedy took office he privately instructed the cia that any plan must include plausible deniability by the us his public position was in opposition in june  the dominican republics leader was assassinated in the days following undersecretary of state chester bowles led a cautious reaction by the nation robert kennedy who saw an opportunity for the us called bowles a gutless bastard to his face laos after the election eisenhower emphasized to kennedy that the communist threat in southeast asia required priority eisenhower considered laos to be the cork in the bottle in regards to the regional threat in march  kennedy voiced a change in policy from supporting a free laos to a neutral laos indicating privately that vietnam should be deemed americas tripwire for communisms spread in the area though he was unwilling to commit us forces to a major military intervention in laos kennedy did approve cia activities designed to defeat communist insurgents through bombing raids and the recruitment of the hmong people vietnam during his presidency kennedy continued policies that provided political economic and military support to the south vietnamese government vietnam had been divided into a communist north vietnam and a noncommunist south vietnam after the  geneva conference but kennedy escalated american involvement in vietnam in  by financing the south vietnam army increasing the number of us military advisors above the levels of the eisenhower administration and authorizing us helicopter units to provide support to south vietnamese forces on january   kennedy formally authorized escalated involvement when he signed the national security action memorandum nsam  subversive insurgency war of liberation operation ranch hand a largescale aerial defoliation effort using the herbicide agent orange began on the roadsides of south vietnam to combat guerrilla defendants though kennedy provided support for south vietnam throughout his tenure vietnam remained a secondary issue for the kennedy administration until  on september  kennedy declared in an interview with walter cronkite of cbs in the final analysis it is their war they are the ones who have to win it or lose it we can help them we can give them equipment we can send our men out there as advisers but they have to win it the people of vietnam against the communists but i dont agree with those who say we should withdraw that would be a great mistake the united states made this effort to defend europe now europe is quite secure we also have to participatewe may not like itin the defense of asia kennedy increasingly soured on the president of south vietnam ngo dinh diem whose violent crackdown on buddhist practices galvanized opposition to his leadership in august  henry cabot lodge jr replaced frederick nolting as the us ambassador to south vietnam days after his arrival in south vietnam lodge reported that several south vietnamese generals sought the assent of the us government to their plan of removing diem from power the kennedy administration was split regarding not just the removal of diem but also their assessment of the military situation and the proper us role in the country after the state department sent a diplomatic cable to lodge that ordered him to pressure diem to remove military authority from his brother ngo inh nhu or face potential withdrawal of us support and removal from power kennedy instructed lodge to offer covert assistance to a coup detat excluding assassination on november   a junta of senior military officers executed the coup which led to the arrest and assassinations of diem and nhu on november  by november  there were  american military personnel in south vietnam up from eisenhowers  advisors more than one hundred americans had been killed in action and no final policy decision was made in the aftermath of the aborted coup in september  the kennedy administration reevaluated its policies in south vietnam kennedy rejected the fullscale deployment of ground soldiers but also the total withdrawal of us forces historians disagree on whether the us military presence in vietnam would have escalated had kennedy survived and been reelected in  fueling the debate are statements made by secretary of defense mcnamara in the  documentary film the fog of war that kennedy was strongly considering pulling out of vietnam after the  election and comments made by kennedy administration white house counsel and speechwriter ted sorensen in a  memoir suggesting that kennedy was undecided about what policy direction to take on october   kennedy signed nsam  ordering the withdrawal of  military personnel by the end of the year following the third recommendation of the mcnamarataylor mission report which concluded that the training program for the south vietnamese military had sufficiently progressed to justify the withdrawal however nsam  also approved the first recommendation of the report to continue providing support to south vietnam to prevent the spread of communism and until the viet cong was suppressed while the third recommendation suggested that even if the majority of the us military objective was completed by the end of  that continued presence of us training personnel in more limited numbers could be necessary if the insurgency was not suppressed west berlin speech in  germany was enduring a time of particular vulnerability due to soviet aggression to the east as well as the impending retirement of west german chancellor adenauer at the same time french president charles de gaulle was trying to build a francowest german counterweight to the american and soviet spheres of influence to kennedys eyes this francogerman cooperation seemed directed against natos influence in europe to reinforce the us alliance with west germany kennedy travelled to west germany and west berlin in june  on june  kennedy toured west berlin culminating in a public speech at the city hall in front of hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic berliners he reiterated the american commitment to germany and criticized communism and was met with an ecstatic response from the massive audience kennedy used the construction of the berlin wall as an example of the failures of communism freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect but we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in to prevent them from leaving us the speech is known for its famous phrase ich bin ein berliner i am a berliner middle east kennedy ended the arms embargo that the truman and eisenhower administrations had enforced on israel in favor of increased security ties becoming the founder of the usisraeli military alliance describing the protection of israel as a moral and national commitment he was the first to introduce the concept of a special relationship between the us and israel in  the kennedy administration sold israel a major weapon system the hawk antiaircraft missile historians differ as to whether kennedy pursued security ties with israel primarily to shore up support with jewishamerican voters or because he admired the jewish state in december  abd alkarim qasims iraqi government passed public law  which restricted the partially americancontrolled iraq petroleum company ipcs concessionary holding to those areas in which oil was actually being produced namely the fields at az zubair and kirkuk effectively expropriating  of the ipc concession british and us officials demanded that the kennedy administration place pressure on the qasim regime in april  the state department issued new guidelines on iraq that were intended to increase american influence meanwhile kennedy instructed the ciaunder the direction of archibald bulloch roosevelt jrto begin making preparations for a military coup against qasim the antiimperialist and anticommunist iraqi baath party overthrew and executed qasim in a violent coup on february   despite persistent rumors that the cia orchestrated the coup declassified documents and the testimony of former cia officers indicate that there was no direct american involvement the kennedy administration was pleased with the outcome and ultimately approved a million arms deal for iraq ireland during his fourday visit to his ancestral home of ireland beginning on june   kennedy accepted a grant of armorial bearings from the chief herald of ireland received honorary degrees from the national university of ireland and trinity college dublin attended a state dinner in dublin and was conferred with the freedom of the towns and cities of wexford cork dublin galway and limerick he visited the cottage at dunganstown near new ross county wexford where his ancestors had lived before emigrating to america kennedy was the first foreign leader to address the houses of the oireachtas the irish parliament kennedy later told aides that the trip was the best four days of his life american university speech on june   kennedy at the high point of his rhetorical powers delivered the commencement address at american university also known as a strategy of peace not only did kennedy outline a plan to curb nuclear arms but he also laid out a hopeful yet realistic route for world peace at a time when the us and soviet union faced the potential for an escalating nuclear arms race kennedy also announced that the soviets had expressed a desire to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty and that the us had postponed planned atmospheric tests nuclear test ban treaty troubled by the longterm dangers of radioactive contamination and nuclear proliferation kennedy and khrushchev agreed to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty originally conceived in adlai stevensons  presidential campaign in their vienna summit meeting in june  khrushchev and kennedy reached an informal understanding against nuclear testing but the soviet union began testing nuclear weapons that september in response the united states conducted tests five days later shortly afterwards new us satellites began delivering images that made it clear that the soviets were substantially behind the us in the arms race nevertheless the greater nuclear strength of the us was of little value as long as the soviet union perceived itself to be at parity in july  kennedy sent w averell harriman to moscow to negotiate a treaty with the soviets the introductory sessions included khrushchev who later delegated soviet representation to andrei gromyko it quickly became clear that a comprehensive test ban would not be implemented due largely to the reluctance of the soviets to allow inspections to verify compliance ultimately the united states the united kingdom and the soviet union were the initial signatories to a limited treaty which prohibited atomic testing on the ground in the atmosphere or underwater but not underground the us senate approved the treaty on september   and kennedy signed it on october   france was quick to declare that it was free to continue developing and testing its nuclear defenses domestic policy new frontier kennedy called his domestic proposals the new frontier however kennedys small margin of victory in the  election his lack of deep connections to influential members of congress and his administrations focus on foreign policy hindered the passage of new frontier policies in  kennedy prioritized passing five bills federal assistance for education medical insurance for the elderly housing legislation federal aid to struggling areas and an increase in the federal minimum wage kennedys bill to increase the federal minimum wage to  an hour passed in early  but an amendment inserted by conservative leader from georgia carl vinson exempted laundry workers from the law kennedy also won passage of the area redevelopment act and the housing act of  the area redevelopment act a  million program provided federal funding to economically struggling regions primarily in appalachia while the housing act of  provided funds for urban renewal and public housing and authorized federal mortgage loans to those who did not qualify for public housing kennedy proposed a bill providing for  billion in federal educational aid to the states with more money going to states with lower per capita income though the senate passed the education bill it was defeated in the house by a coalition of republicans southern democrats and catholics kennedys health insurance bill which would have paid for hospitalization and nursing costs for the elderly failed to pass either house of congress a bill that would have established the department of urban affairs and housing was also defeated in  kennedy won approval of the manpower development and training act a threeyear program aimed at retraining workers displaced by new technology its impact on structural unemployment however was minimal at the urging of his sister eunice kennedy made intellectual disabilities a priority for his administration in  congress passed the community mental health act which provided funding to local mental health community centers and research facilities trade policy included both domestic and foreign policy the  trade expansion act was passed by congress with wide majorities it authorized the president to negotiate tariff reductions on a reciprocal basis of up to  percent with the european common market the legislation paved the way for the kennedy round of general agreement on tariffs and trade negotiations concluding on june   the last day before expiration of the act taxes walter heller who served as the chairman of the cea advocated for a keynesianstyle tax cut designed to help spur economic growth and kennedy adopted this policy the idea was that a tax cut would stimulate consumer demand which in turn would lead to higher economic growth lower unemployment and increased federal revenues to the disappointment of liberals like john kenneth galbraith kennedys embrace of the tax cut shifted his administrations focus away from the proposed oldage health insurance program and other domestic expenditures in january  kennedy proposed a tax cut that would reduce the top marginal tax rate from  to  percent and lower the corporate tax rate from  to  percent the predictions according to the keynesian model indicated the cuts would decrease income taxes by about  billion and corporate taxes by about  billion the plan included reforms designed to reduce the impact of itemized deductions as well as provisions to help the elderly and handicapped republicans and many southern democrats opposed the bill calling for simultaneous reductions in expenditures but debate continued throughout  three months after kennedy died johnson pushed the plan through congress the revenue act of  lowered the top individual rate to  percent and the top corporate rate to  percent economy kennedy ended a period of tight fiscal policies loosening monetary policy to keep interest rates down and to encourage growth of the economy he presided over the first government budget to top the  billion mark in  and his first budget in  resulted in the nations first nonwar nonrecession deficit the economy which had been through two recessions in three years and was in one when kennedy took office accelerated notably throughout his administration despite low inflation and interest rates the gdp had grown by an average of only  per annum during the eisenhower administration scarcely more than population growth at the time and it had declined by  during eisenhowers last twelve months in office the economy turned around and prospered during kennedys presidency the gdp expanded by an average of  from early  to late  while inflation remained steady at around  and unemployment eased industrial production rose by  and motor vehicle sales increased by  this sustained rate of growth in gdp and industry continued until around  kennedy was proud that his labor department helped keep wages steady in the steel industry but was outraged in april  when roger blough the president of us steel quietly informed kennedy that his company would raise prices in response attorney general robert kennedy began a pricefixing investigation against us steel and president kennedy convinced other steel companies to rescind their price increases until finally even us steel isolated and in danger of being undersold agreed to rescind its own price increase an editorial in the new york times praised kennedys actions and stated that the steel industrys price increase imperiled the economic welfare of the country by inviting a tidal wave of inflation nevertheless the administrations bureau of budget reported the price increase would have caused a net gain for the gdp as well as a net budget surplus the stock market which had steadily declined since kennedys election in  dropped  shortly after the administrations action on the steel industry took place civil rights movement kennedy verbally supported civil rights during his  presidential campaign he telephoned coretta scott king wife of martin luther king jr who had been jailed while trying to integrate a department store lunch counter robert kennedy called georgia governor ernest vandiver and obtained kings release from prison which drew additional black support to his brothers candidacy recognizing that conservative southern democrats could block legislation kennedy did not introduce civil rights legislation on taking office he needed their support to pass his economic and foreign policy agendas and to support his reelection in  kennedy did appoint many blacks to office including civil rights attorney thurgood marshall to the us court of appeals abraham bolden the first black secret service agent was appointed by kennedy kennedy believed the grassroots movement for civil rights would anger many southern whites and make it more difficult to pass civil rights laws in congress and he distanced himself from it as articulated by robert kennedy the administrations early priority was to keep the president out of this civil rights mess civil rights movement participants mainly those on the front line in the south viewed kennedy as lukewarm especially concerning the freedom riders in may  the congress of racial equality led by james farmer organized integrated freedom rides to test a supreme court case ruling that declared segregation on interstate transportation illegal the riders were repeatedly met with mob violence including by federal and state law enforcement officers kennedy assigned federal marshals to protect the riders rather than using federal troops or uncooperative fbi agents kennedy feared sending federal troops would stir up hated memories of reconstruction among conservative southern whites the justice department then petitioned the interstate commerce commission icc to adhere to federal law by september  the icc ruled in favor of the petition on march   kennedy signed executive order  which required government contractors to take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race creed color or national origin it established the presidents committee on equal employment opportunity in september  james meredith enrolled at the allwhite university of mississippi but was prevented from entering in response attorney general robert kennedy sent  federal marshals the ole miss riot of  left two dead and dozens injured prompting kennedy to send in  troops to quell the riot meredith did finally enroll in class kennedy regretted not sending in troops earlier and he began to doubt whether the evils of reconstruction he had been taught or believed were true on november   kennedy signed executive order  which prohibited racial discrimination in federally supported housing on june   kennedy intervened when alabama governor george wallace blocked the doorway to the university of alabama to stop two black students vivian malone and james hood from attending wallace moved aside only after being confronted by deputy attorney general nicholas katzenbach and the alabama national guard which had just been federalized by order of the president that evening kennedy gave his famous report to the american people on civil rights speech on national television and radio launching his initiative for civil rights legislationto provide equal access to public schools and other facilities and greater protection of voting rights his proposals became part of the civil rights act of  the day ended with the murder of an naacp leader medgar evers in mississippi as kennedy had predicted the day after his tv speech and in reaction to it house majority leader carl albert called to advise him that his twoyear signature effort in congress to combat poverty in appalachia had been defeated primarily by the votes of southern democrats and republicans when arthur schlesinger jr complimented kennedy on his remarks kennedy bitterly replied yes and look at what happened to area development the very next day in the house he then added but of course i had to give that speech and im glad that i did on june  the new york times published an editorial which argued that while kennedy had initially moved too slowly and with little evidence of deep moral commitment in regards to civil rights he now demonstrated a genuine sense of urgency about eradicating racial discrimination from our national life a crowd of over  predominantly african americans gathered in washington for the civil rights march on washington for jobs and freedom on august   kennedy initially opposed the march fearing it would have a negative effect on the prospects for the civil rights bills pending in congress these fears were heightened just prior to the march when fbi director j edgar hoover presented kennedy with reports that some of kings close advisers specifically jack odell and stanley levison were communists when king ignored the administrations warning robert kennedy authorized the fbi to wiretap king and other leaders of the southern christian leadership conference although kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of kings phones on a trial basis for a month or so hoover extended the clearance so his men were unshackled to look for evidence in any areas of kings life they deemed worthy the department of justice was assigned to coordinate the federal governments involvement in the march on washington on august  several hundred thousand dollars were channeled to the six sponsors of the march to ensure a peaceful demonstration the organizers and the president personally edited speeches that were inflammatory and collaborated on all aspects related to times and venues thousands of troops were placed on standby kennedy watched kings speech on tv and was very impressed the march was considered a triumph of managed protest and not one arrest relating to the demonstration occurred afterwards the march leaders accepted an invitation to the white house to meet with kennedy and photos were taken kennedy felt that the march was a victory for him as well and bolstered the chances for his civil rights bill three weeks later on sunday september  a bomb exploded at the th street baptist church in birmingham by the end of the day four black children had died in the explosion and two others were shot to death in the aftermath due to this resurgent violence the civil rights legislation underwent some drastic amendments that critically endangered any prospects for passage of the bill to the outrage of kennedy he called the congressional leaders to the white house and by the following day the original bill without the additions had enough votes to get it out of the house committee gaining republican support senator everett dirksen promised the legislation would be brought to a vote preventing a senate filibuster on july   the guarantees kennedy proposed in his june  speech became federal law when president johnson signed the civil rights act status of women during the  presidential campaign kennedy endorsed the concept of equal pay for equal work in december  kennedy signed an executive order creating the presidential commission on the status of women to advise him on issues concerning the status of women former first lady eleanor roosevelt led the commission the commissions final report was issued in october  it documented the legal and cultural discrimination women in america faced and made several policy recommendations to bring about change on june   kennedy signed the equal pay act of  which amended the fair labor standards act and abolished wage disparity based on sex crime under the leadership of the attorney general the kennedy administration shifted the focus of the justice department the fbi and the irs to organized crime kennedy won congressional approval for five bills ie federal wire act of  designed to crack down on interstate racketeering gambling and the transportation of firearms on march   kennedy signed into law a bill abolishing the mandatory death penalty for first degree murder in the district of columbia the only remaining jurisdiction in the united states with such a penalty the death penalty has not been applied in dc since  and has now been abolished agriculture kennedy had relatively little interest in agricultural issues but he sought to remedy the issue of overproduction boost the income of farmers and lower federal expenditures on agriculture under the direction of secretary of agriculture orville freeman the administration sought to limit the production of farmers but these proposals were generally defeated in congress to increase demand for domestic agricultural products and help the impoverished kennedy launched a pilot food stamp program and expanded the federal school lunch program native american relations construction of the kinzua dam flooded  acres  hectares of seneca nation land that they had occupied under the treaty of  and forced  seneca to relocate to salamanca new york kennedy was asked by the american civil liberties union to halt the project but he declined citing a critical need for flood control he expressed concern about the plight of the seneca and directed government agencies to assist in obtaining more land damages and assistance to mitigate their displacement space policy in the aftermath of the soviet launch of sputnik  the first artificial earth satellite nasa proposed a crewed lunar landing by the early s funding for the program known as the apollo program was far from certain as eisenhower held an ambivalent attitude early in his presidency kennedy was poised to dismantle the crewed space program but he postponed any decision out of deference to vice president johnson who had been a strong supporter of the program in the senate with jerome wiesner johnson was given a major role in overseeing the administrations space policy and at johnsons recommendation kennedy appointed james e webb to head nasa in kennedys state of the union address in  he suggested international cooperation in space khrushchev declined as the soviets did not wish to reveal the status of their rocketry and space capabilities in april  soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin became the first person to fly in space reinforcing american fears about being left behind by the soviet union less than a month later alan shepard became the first american to travel into space strengthening kennedys confidence in nasa the following year john glenn aboard the mercury craft friendship  became the first american to orbit the earth in the aftermath of gagarins flight as well as the failed bay of pigs invasion kennedy felt pressured to respond to the perceived erosion of american prestige he asked johnson to explore the feasibility of beating the soviets to the moon though he was concerned about the programs costs kennedy agreed to johnsons recommendation that the us commit to a crewed lunar landing as the major objective of the space program in a may  speech to congress kennedy declared  i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth no single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind or more important for the longrange exploration of space and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish though gallup polling showed that many in the public were skeptical of the necessity of the apollo program members of congress were strongly supportive in  and approved a major increase in nasas funding webb began reorganizing nasa increasing its staffing level and building two new centers a launch operations center for the large moon rocket northwest of cape canaveral air force station and a manned spacecraft center in houston kennedy took the latter occasion as an opportunity to deliver another speech promoting the space effort on september   in which he said no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space  we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard on november   in a cabinet meeting with webb and other officials kennedy explained that the moon shot was important for reasons of international prestige and that the expense was justified on july   almost six years after kennedys death apollo  landed the first crewed spacecraft on the moon judicial appointments in  kennedy appointed justices byron white and arthur goldberg to the supreme court additionally kennedy appointed  judges to the united states courts of appeals and  judges to the united states district courts assassination kennedy was assassinated in dallas at  pm central standard time on november   he was in texas on a political trip to smooth over frictions in the democratic party between liberals ralph yarborough and don yarborough no relation and conservative john connally while traveling in a presidential motorcade through dealey plaza he was shot once in the back the bullet exiting via his throat and once in the head kennedy was taken to parkland hospital where he was pronounced dead  minutes later at  pm he was  years old lee harvey oswald was arrested for the murder of police officer j d tippit and was subsequently charged with kennedys assassination oswald denied shooting anyone claiming he was a patsy on november  before he could be prosecuted he was shot and killed by jack ruby ruby was arrested and convicted for the murder of oswald ruby successfully appealed his conviction but died of cancer on january   while the date for his new trial was being set president johnson quickly issued an executive order to create the warren commissionchaired by chief justice earl warrento investigate the assassination the commission concluded that oswald acted alone in killing kennedy and that oswald was not part of any conspiracy these conclusions are disputed by many a gallup poll in november  showed  believed in a conspiracy and only  thought that oswald did it alone in  the us house select committee on assassinations concluded with one third of the committee dissenting that kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy the committee was unable to identify the other gunmen or the extent of the conspiracy this conclusion was based largely on audio recordings of the shooting subsequently investigative reports from the fbi and a specially appointed national academy of sciences committee determined that reliable acoustic data do not support a conclusion that there was a second gunman the justice department later concluded that no persuasive evidence can be identified to support the theory of a conspiracy funeral kennedys body was brought back to washington on november  six military pallbearers carried the flagdraped coffin into the east room of the white house where he lay in repose for  hours the coffin was then transported on a horsedrawn caisson to the

house physician janet travell disclosed that kennedy also had hypothyroidism the presence of two endocrine diseases raises the possibility that kennedy had autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type

pain during the  vienna summit the combination included hormones animal organ cells steroids vitamins enzymes and amphetamines and possible side effects included hyperactivity hypertension impaired
