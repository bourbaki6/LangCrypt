a computer is a machine that can be programmed to automatically carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations computation modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs which enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks the term computer system may refer to a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware operating system software and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation or to a group of computers that are linked and function together such as a computer network or computer cluster a broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems including simple specialpurpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls and factory devices like industrial robots computers are at the core of generalpurpose devices such as personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones computers power the internet which links billions of computers and users early computers were meant to be used only for calculations simple manual instruments like the abacus have aided people in doing calculations since ancient times early in the industrial revolution some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks such as guiding patterns for looms more sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early th century the first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during world war ii both electromechanical and using thermionic valves the first semiconductor transistors in the late s were followed by the siliconbased mosfet mos transistor and monolithic integrated circuit chip technologies in the late s leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the s the speed power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then with transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace moores law noted that counts doubled every two years leading to the digital revolution during the late th and early st centuries conventionally a modern computer consists of at least one processing element typically a central processing unit cpu in the form of a microprocessor together with some type of computer memory typically semiconductor memory chips the processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information peripheral devices include input devices keyboards mice joysticks etc output devices monitors printers etc and inputoutput devices that perform both functions eg touchscreens peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the results of operations to be saved and retrieved etymology it was not until the midth century that the word acquired its modern definition according to the oxford english dictionary the first known use of the word computer was in a different sense in a  book called the yong mans gleanings by the english writer richard brathwait i haue sic read the truest computer of times and the best arithmetician that euer sic breathed and he reduceth thy dayes into a short number this usage of the term referred to a human computer a person who carried out calculations or computations the word continued to have the same meaning until the middle of the th century during the latter part of this period women were often hired as computers because they could be paid less than their male counterparts by  most human computers were women the online etymology dictionary gives the first attested use of computer in the s meaning one who calculates this is an agent noun from compute v the online etymology dictionary states that the use of the term to mean calculating machine of any type is from  the online etymology dictionary indicates that the modern use of the term to mean programmable digital electronic computer dates from  under this name in a theoretical sense from  as turing machine the name has remained although modern computers are capable of many higherlevel functions history preth century devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years mostly using onetoone correspondence with fingers the earliest counting device was most likely a form of tally stick later record keeping aids throughout the fertile crescent included calculi clay spheres cones etc which represented counts of items likely livestock or grains sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers the use of counting rods is one example the abacus was initially used for arithmetic tasks the roman abacus was developed from devices used in babylonia as early as  bce since then many other forms of reckoning boards or tables have been invented in a medieval european counting house a checkered cloth would be placed on a table and markers moved around on it according to certain rules as an aid to calculating sums of money the antikythera mechanism is believed to be the earliest known mechanical analog computer according to derek j de solla price it was designed to calculate astronomical positions it was discovered in  in the antikythera wreck off the greek island of antikythera between kythera and crete and has been dated to approximately c  bce devices of comparable complexity to the antikythera mechanism would not reappear until the fourteenth century many mechanical aids to calculation and measurement were constructed for astronomical and navigation use the planisphere was a star chart invented by abu rayhan albiruni in the early th century the astrolabe was invented in the hellenistic world in either the st or nd centuries bce and is often attributed to hipparchus a combination of the planisphere and dioptra the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several different kinds of problems in spherical astronomy an astrolabe incorporating a mechanical calendar computer and gearwheels was invented by abi bakr of isfahan persia in  abu rayhan albiruni invented the first mechanical geared lunisolar calendar astrolabe an early fixedwired knowledge processing machine with a gear train and gearwheels c  ad the sector a calculating instrument used for solving problems in proportion trigonometry multiplication and division and for various functions such as squares and cube roots was developed in the late th century and found application in gunnery surveying and navigation the planimeter was a manual instrument to calculate the area of a closed figure by tracing over it with a mechanical linkage the slide rule was invented around  by the english clergyman william oughtred shortly after the publication of the concept of the logarithm it is a handoperated analog computer for doing multiplication and division as slide rule development progressed added scales provided reciprocals squares and square roots cubes and cube roots as well as transcendental functions such as logarithms and exponentials circular and hyperbolic trigonometry and other functions slide rules with special scales are still used for quick performance of routine calculations such as the eb circular slide rule used for time and distance calculations on light aircraft in the s pierre jaquetdroz a swiss watchmaker built a mechanical doll automaton that could write holding a quill pen by switching the number and order of its internal wheels different letters and hence different messages could be produced in effect it could be mechanically programmed to read instructions along with two other complex machines the doll is at the musee dart et dhistoire of neuchatel switzerland and still operates in  mathematician and engineer giovanni plana devised a perpetual calendar machine which through a system of pulleys and cylinders could predict the perpetual calendar for every year from  ce that is  bce to  ce keeping track of leap years and varying day length the tidepredicting machine invented by the scottish scientist sir william thomson in  was of great utility to navigation in shallow waters it used a system of pulleys and wires to automatically calculate predicted tide levels for a set period at a particular location the differential analyser a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration used wheelanddisc mechanisms to perform the integration in  sir william thomson had already discussed the possible construction of such calculators but he had been stymied by the limited output torque of the ballanddisk integrators in a differential analyzer the output of one integrator drove the input of the next integrator or a graphing output the torque amplifier was the advance that allowed these machines to work starting in the s vannevar bush and others developed mechanical differential analyzers in the s the spanish engineer leonardo torres quevedo began to develop a series of advanced analog machines that could solve real and complex roots of polynomials which were published in  by the paris academy of sciences first computer charles babbage an english mechanical engineer and polymath originated the concept of a programmable computer considered the father of the computer he conceptualized and invented the first mechanical computer in the early th century after working on his difference engine he announced his invention in  in a paper to the royal astronomical society titled note on the application of machinery to the computation of astronomical and mathematical tables he also designed to aid in navigational calculations in  he realized that a much more general design an analytical engine was possible the input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the jacquard loom for output the machine would have a printer a curve plotter and a bell the machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later the engine would incorporate an arithmetic logic unit control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops and integrated memory making it the first design for a generalpurpose computer that could be described in modern terms as turingcomplete the machine was about a century ahead of its time all the parts for his machine had to be made by hand  this was a major problem for a device with thousands of parts eventually the project was dissolved with the decision of the british government to cease funding babbages failure to complete the analytical engine can be chiefly attributed to political and financial difficulties as well as his desire to develop an increasingly sophisticated computer and to move ahead faster than anyone else could follow nevertheless his son henry babbage completed a simplified version of the analytical engines computing unit the mill in  he gave a successful demonstration of its use in computing tables in  electromechanical calculating machine in his work essays on automatics published in  leonardo torres quevedo wrote a brief history of babbages efforts at constructing a mechanical difference engine and analytical engine the paper contains a design of a machine capable to calculate formulas like a x  y  z   displaystyle axyz  for a sequence of sets of values the whole machine was to be controlled by a readonly program which was complete with provisions for conditional branching he also introduced the idea of floatingpoint arithmetic in  to celebrate the th anniversary of the invention of the arithmometer torres presented in paris the electromechanical arithmometer which allowed a user to input arithmetic problems through a keyboard and computed and printed the results demonstrating the feasibility of an electromechanical analytical engine analog computers during the first half of the th century many scientific computing needs were met by increasingly sophisticated analog computers which used a direct mechanical or electrical model of the problem as a basis for computation however these were not programmable and generally lacked the versatility and accuracy of modern digital computers the first modern analog computer was a tidepredicting machine invented by sir william thomson later to become lord kelvin in  the differential analyser a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration using wheelanddisc mechanisms was conceptualized in  by james thomson the elder brother of the more famous sir william thomson the art of mechanical analog computing reached its zenith with the differential analyzer completed in  by vannevar bush at mit by the s the success of digital electronic computers had spelled the end for most analog computing machines but analog computers remained in use during the s in some specialized applications such as education slide rule and aircraft control systems digital computers electromechanical claude shannons  masters thesis laid the foundations of digital computing with his insight of applying boolean algebra to the analysis and synthesis of switching circuits being the basic concept which underlies all electronic digital computers by  the united states navy had developed the torpedo data computer an electromechanical analog computer for submarines that used trigonometry to solve the problem of firing a torpedo at a moving target during world war ii similar devices were developed in other countries early digital computers were electromechanical electric switches drove mechanical relays to perform the calculation these devices had a low operating speed and were eventually superseded by much faster allelectric computers originally using vacuum tubes the z created by german engineer konrad zuse in  in berlin was one of the earliest examples of an electromechanical relay computer in  zuse followed his earlier machine up with the z the worlds first working electromechanical programmable fully automatic digital computer the z was built with  relays implementing a  bit word length that operated at a clock frequency of about  hz program code was supplied on punched film while data could be stored in  words of memory or supplied from the keyboard it was quite similar to modern machines in some respects pioneering numerous advances such as floatingpoint numbers rather than the hardertoimplement decimal system used in charles babbages earlier design using a binary system meant that zuses machines were easier to build and potentially more reliable given the technologies available at that time the z was not itself a universal computer but could be extended to be turing complete zuses next computer the z became the worlds first commercial computer after initial delay due to the second world war it was completed in  and delivered to the eth zurich the computer was manufactured by zuses own company zuse kg which was founded in  as the first company with the sole purpose of developing computers in berlin the z served as the inspiration for the construction of the ermeth the first swiss computer and one of the first in europe vacuum tubes and digital electronic circuits purely electronic circuit elements soon replaced their mechanical and electromechanical equivalents at the same time that digital calculation replaced analog the engineer tommy flowers working at the post office research station in london in the s began to explore the possible use of electronics for the telephone exchange experimental equipment that he built in  went into operation five years later converting a portion of the telephone exchange network into an electronic data processing system using thousands of vacuum tubes in the us john vincent atanasoff and clifford e berry of iowa state university developed and tested the atanasoffberry computer abc in  the first automatic electronic digital computer this design was also allelectronic and used about  vacuum tubes with capacitors fixed in a mechanically rotating drum for memory during world war ii the british codebreakers at bletchley park achieved a number of successes at breaking encrypted german military communications the german encryption machine enigma was first attacked with the help of the electromechanical bombes which were often run by women to crack the more sophisticated german lorenz sz  machine used for highlevel army communications max newman and his colleagues commissioned flowers to build the colossus he spent eleven months from early february  designing and building the first colossus after a functional test in december  colossus was shipped to bletchley park where it was delivered on  january  and attacked its first message on  february colossus was the worlds first electronic digital programmable computer it used a large number of valves vacuum tubes it had papertape input and was capable of being configured to perform a variety of boolean logical operations on its data but it was not turingcomplete nine mk ii colossi were built the mk i was converted to a mk ii making ten machines in total colossus mark i contained  thermionic valves tubes but mark ii with  valves was both five times faster and simpler to operate than mark i greatly speeding the decoding process the eniac electronic numerical integrator and computer was the first electronic programmable computer built in the us although the eniac was similar to the colossus it was much faster more flexible and it was turingcomplete like the colossus a program on the eniac was defined by the states of its patch cables and switches a far cry from the stored program electronic machines that came later once a program was written it had to be mechanically set into the machine with manual resetting of plugs and switches the programmers of the eniac were six women often known collectively as the eniac girls it combined the high speed of electronics with the ability to be programmed for many complex problems it could add or subtract  times a second a thousand times faster than any other machine it also had modules to multiply divide and square root high speed memory was limited to  words about  bytes built under the direction of john mauchly and j presper eckert at the university of pennsylvania eniacs development and construction lasted from  to full operation at the end of  the machine was huge weighing  tons using  kilowatts of electric power and contained over  vacuum tubes  relays and hundreds of thousands of resistors capacitors and inductors modern computers concept of modern computer the principle of the modern computer was proposed by alan turing in his seminal  paper on computable numbers turing proposed a simple device that he called universal computing machine and that is now known as a universal turing machine he proved that such a machine is capable of computing anything that is computable by executing instructions program stored on tape allowing the machine to be programmable the fundamental concept of turings design is the stored program where all the instructions for computing are stored in memory von neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper turing machines are to this day a central object of study in theory of computation except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores modern computers are said to be turingcomplete which is to say they have algorithm execution capability equivalent to a universal turing machine stored programs early computing machines had fixed programs changing its function required the rewiring and restructuring of the machine with the proposal of the storedprogram computer this changed a storedprogram computer includes by design an instruction set and can store in memory a set of instructions a program that details the computation the theoretical basis for the storedprogram computer was laid out by alan turing in his  paper in  turing joined the national physical laboratory and began work on developing an electronic storedprogram digital computer his  report proposed electronic calculator was the first specification for such a device john von neumann at the university of pennsylvania also circulated his first draft of a report on the edvac in  the manchester baby was the worlds first storedprogram computer it was built at the university of manchester in england by frederic c williams tom kilburn and geoff tootill and ran its first program on  june  it was designed as a testbed for the williams tube the first randomaccess digital storage device although the computer was described as small and primitive by a  retrospective it was the first working machine to contain all of the elements essential to a modern electronic computer as soon as the baby had demonstrated the feasibility of its design a project began at the university to develop it into a practically useful computer the manchester mark  the mark  in turn quickly became the prototype for the ferranti mark  the worlds first commercially available generalpurpose computer built by ferranti it was delivered to the university of manchester in february  at least seven of these later machines were delivered between  and  one of them to shell labs in amsterdam in october  the directors of british catering company j lyons  company decided to take an active role in promoting the commercial development of computers lyonss leo i computer modelled closely on the cambridge edsac of  became operational in april  and ran the worlds first routine office computer job transistors the concept of a fieldeffect transistor was proposed by julius edgar lilienfeld in  john bardeen and walter brattain while working under william shockley at bell labs built the first working transistor the pointcontact transistor in  which was followed by shockleys bipolar junction transistor in  from  onwards transistors replaced vacuum tubes in computer designs giving rise to the second generation of computers compared to vacuum tubes transistors have many advantages they are smaller and require less power than vacuum tubes so give off less heat junction transistors were much more reliable than vacuum tubes and had longer indefinite service life transistorized computers could contain tens of thousands of binary logic circuits in a relatively compact space however early junction transistors were relatively bulky devices that were difficult to manufacture on a massproduction basis which limited them to a number of specialized applications at the university of manchester a team under the leadership of tom kilburn designed and built a machine using the newly developed transistors instead of valves their first transistorized computer and the first in the world was operational by  and a second version was completed there in april  however the machine did make use of valves to generate its  khz clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its magnetic drum memory so it was not the first completely transistorized computer that distinction goes to the harwell cadet of  built by the electronics division of the atomic energy research establishment at harwell the metaloxidesilicon fieldeffect transistor mosfet also known as the mos transistor was invented at bell labs between  and  and was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturized and massproduced for a wide range of uses with its high scalability and much lower power consumption and higher density than bipolar junction transistors the mosfet made it possible to build highdensity integrated circuits in addition to data processing it also enabled the practical use of mos transistors as memory cell storage elements leading to the development of mos semiconductor memory which replaced earlier magneticcore memory in computers the mosfet led to the microcomputer revolution and became the driving force behind the computer revolution the mosfet is the most widely used transistor in computers and is the fundamental building block of digital electronics integrated circuits the next great advance in computing power came with the advent of the integrated circuit ic the idea of the integrated circuit was first conceived by a radar scientist working for the royal radar establishment of the ministry of defence geoffrey wa dummer dummer presented the first public description of an integrated circuit at the symposium on progress in quality electronic components in washington dc on  may  the first working ics were invented by jack kilby at texas instruments and robert noyce at fairchild semiconductor kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in july  successfully demonstrating the first working integrated example on  september  in his patent application of  february  kilby described his new device as a body of semiconductor material  wherein all the components of the electronic circuit are completely integrated however kilbys invention was a hybrid integrated circuit hybrid ic rather than a monolithic integrated circuit ic chip kilbys ic had external wire connections which made it difficult to massproduce noyce also came up with his own idea of an integrated circuit half a year later than kilby noyces invention was the first true monolithic ic chip his chip solved many practical problems that kilbys had not produced at fairchild semiconductor it was made of silicon whereas kilbys chip was made of germanium noyces monolithic ic was fabricated using the planar process developed by his colleague jean hoerni in early  in turn the planar process was based on carl frosch and lincoln derick work on semiconductor surface passivation by silicon dioxide modern monolithic ics are predominantly mos metaloxidesemiconductor integrated circuits built from mosfets mos transistors the earliest experimental mos ic to be fabricated was a transistor chip built by fred heiman and steven hofstein at rca in  general microelectronics later introduced the first commercial mos ic in  developed by robert norman following the development of the selfaligned gate silicongate mos transistor by robert kerwin donald klein and john sarace at bell labs in  the first silicongate mos ic with selfaligned gates was developed by federico faggin at fairchild semiconductor in  the mosfet has since become the most critical device component in modern ics the development of the mos integrated circuit led to the invention of the microprocessor and heralded an explosion in the commercial and personal use of computers while the subject of exactly which device was the first microprocessor is contentious partly due to lack of agreement on the exact definition of the term microprocessor it is largely undisputed that the first singlechip microprocessor was the intel  designed and realized by federico faggin with his silicongate mos ic technology along with ted hoff masatoshi shima and stanley mazor at intel in the early s mos ic technology enabled the integration of more than  transistors on a single chip system on a chip socs are complete computers on a microchip or chip the size of a coin they may or may not have integrated ram and flash memory if not integrated the ram is usually placed directly above known as package on package or below on the opposite side of the circuit board the soc and the flash memory is usually placed right next to the soc this is done to improve data transfer speeds as the data signals do not have to travel long distances since eniac in  computers have advanced enormously with modern socs such as the snapdragon  being the size of a coin while also being hundreds of thousands of times more powerful than eniac integrating billions of transistors and consuming only a few watts of power mobile computers the first mobile computers were heavy and ran from mains power the  lb  kg ibm  was an early example later portables such as the osborne  and compaq portable were considerably lighter but still needed to be plugged in the first laptops such as the grid compass removed this requirement by incorporating batteries  and with the continued miniaturization of computing resources and advancements in portable battery life portable computers grew in popularity in the s the same developments allowed manufacturers to integrate computing resources into cellular mobile phones by the early s these smartphones and tablets run on a variety of operating systems and recently became the dominant computing device on the market these are powered by system on a chip socs which are complete computers on a microchip the size of a coin types computers can be classified in a number of different ways including by architecture analog computer digital computer hybrid computer harvard architecture von neumann architecture complex instruction set computer reduced

system in a package systemonchip also known as an application processor or ap if it lacks circuitry such as radio circuitry microcontroller unconventional computers a computer does not need to be electronic nor even have a processor nor ram nor even a hard disk while popular usage of the word computer is synonymous with a personal electronic computer a typical modern definition of a computer is a device that computes especially a programmable usually electronic machine that performs highspeed mathematical or logical operations or that assembles stores correlates or otherwise processes information according to this definition any device that processes information qualifies as a computer hardware the term hardware covers all of those parts of a computer that are tangible physical objects circuits computer chips graphic cards sound cards memory ram motherboard displays power supplies cables keyboards printers and mice input devices are all hardware history of computing hardware other hardware topics a generalpurpose computer has four main components the arithmetic logic unit alu the control unit the memory and the input and output devices collectively termed io these parts are interconnected by buses often made of groups of wires inside each of these parts are thousands to trillions of small electrical circuits which can be turned off or on by means of an electronic switch each circuit represents a bit binary digit of information so that when the circuit is on it represents a  and when off it represents a  in positive logic representation the circuits are arranged in logic gates so that one or more of the circuits may control the state of one or more of the other circuits input devices input devices are the means by which the operations of a computer are controlled and it is provided with data examples include computer keyboard digital camera graphics tablet image scanner joystick microphone mouse overlay keyboard realtime clock trackball touchscreen light pen output devices output devices are the means by which a computer provides the results of its calculations in a humanaccessible form examples include computer monitor printer pc speaker projector sound card graphics card control unit the control unit often called a control system or central controller manages the computers various components it reads and interprets decodes the program instructions transforming them into control signals that activate other parts of the computer control systems in advanced computers may change the order of execution of some instructions to improve performance a key component common to all cpus is the program counter a special memory cell a register that keeps track of which location in memory the next instruction is to be read from the control systems function is as follows this is a simplified description and some of these steps may be performed concurrently or in a different order depending on the type of cpu read the code for the next instruction from the cell indicated by the program counter decode the numerical code for the instruction into a set of commands or signals for each of the other systems increment the program counter so it points to the next instruction read whatever data the instruction requires from cells in memory or perhaps from an input device the location of this required data is typically stored within the instruction code provide the necessary data to an alu or register if the instruction requires an alu or specialized hardware to complete instruct the hardware to perform the requested operation write the result from the alu back to a memory location or to a register or perhaps an output device jump back to step  since the program counter is conceptually just another set of memory cells it can be changed by calculations done in the alu adding  to the program counter would cause the next instruction to be read from a place  locations further down the program instructions that modify the program counter are often known as jumps and allow for loops instructions that are repeated by the computer and often conditional instruction execution both examples of control flow the sequence of operations that the control unit goes through to process an instruction is in itself like a short computer program and indeed in some more complex cpu designs there is another yet smaller computer called a microsequencer which runs a microcode program that causes all of these events to happen central processing unit cpu the control unit alu and registers are collectively known as a central processing unit cpu early cpus were composed of many separate components since the s cpus have typically been constructed on a single mos integrated circuit chip called a microprocessor arithmetic logic unit alu the alu is capable of performing two classes of operations arithmetic and logic the set of arithmetic operations that a particular alu supports may be limited to addition and subtraction or might include multiplication division trigonometry functions such as sine cosine etc and square roots some can operate only on whole numbers integers while others use floating point to represent real numbers albeit with limited precision however any computer that is capable of performing just the simplest operations can be programmed to break down the more complex operations into simple steps that it can perform therefore any computer can be programmed to perform any arithmetic operationalthough it will take more time to do so if its alu does not directly support the operation an alu may also compare numbers and return boolean truth values true or false depending on whether one is equal to greater than or less than the other is  greater than  logic operations involve boolean logic and or xor and not these can be useful for creating complicated conditional statements and processing boolean logic superscalar computers may contain multiple alus allowing them to process several instructions simultaneously graphics processors and computers with simd and mimd features often contain alus that can perform arithmetic on vectors and matrices memory a computers memory can be viewed as a list of cells into which numbers can be placed or read each cell has a numbered address and can store a single number the computer can be instructed to put the number  into the cell numbered  or to add the number that is in cell  to the number that is in cell  and put the answer into cell  the information stored in memory may represent practically anything letters numbers even computer instructions can be placed into memory with equal ease since the cpu does not differentiate between different types of information it is the softwares responsibility to give significance to what the memory sees as nothing but a series of numbers in almost all modern computers each memory cell is set up to store binary numbers in groups of eight bits called a byte each byte is able to represent  different numbers    either from  to  or  to  to store larger numbers several consecutive bytes may be used typically two four or eight when negative numbers are required they are usually stored in twos complement notation other arrangements are possible but are usually not seen outside of specialized applications or historical contexts a computer can store any kind of information in memory if it can be represented numerically modern computers have billions or even trillions of bytes of memory the cpu contains a special set of memory cells called registers that can be read and written to much more rapidly than the main memory area there are typically between two and one hundred registers depending on the type of cpu registers are used for the most frequently needed data items to avoid having to access main memory every time data is needed as data is constantly being worked on reducing the need to access main memory which is often slow compared to the alu and control units greatly increases the computers speed computer main memory comes in two principal varieties randomaccess memory or ram readonly memory or rom ram can be read and written to anytime the cpu commands it but rom is preloaded with data and software that never changes therefore the cpu can only read from it rom is typically used to store the computers initial startup instructions in general the contents of ram are erased when the power to the computer is turned off but rom retains its data indefinitely in a pc the rom contains a specialized program called the bios that orchestrates loading the computers operating system from the hard disk drive into ram whenever the computer is turned on or reset in embedded computers which frequently do not have disk drives all of the required software may be stored in rom software stored in rom is often called firmware because it is notionally more like hardware than software flash memory blurs the distinction between rom and ram as it retains its data when turned off but is also rewritable it is typically much slower than conventional rom and ram however so its use is restricted to applications where high speed is unnecessary in more sophisticated computers there may be one or more ram cache memories which are slower than registers but faster than main memory generally computers with this sort of cache are designed to move frequently needed data into the cache automatically often without the need for any intervention on the programmers part inputoutput io io is the means by which a computer exchanges information with the outside world devices that provide input or output to the computer are called peripherals on a typical personal computer peripherals include input devices like the keyboard and mouse and output devices such as the display and printer hard disk drives floppy disk drives and optical disc drives serve as both input and output devices computer networking is another form of io io devices are often complex computers in their own right with their own cpu and memory a graphics processing unit might contain fifty or more tiny computers that perform the calculations necessary to display d graphics modern desktop computers contain many smaller computers that assist the main cpu in performing io a era flat screen display contains its own computer circuitry multitasking while a computer may be viewed as running one gigantic program stored in its main memory in some systems it is necessary to give the appearance of running several programs simultaneously this is achieved by multitasking ie having the computer switch rapidly between running each program in turn one means by which this is done is with a special signal called an interrupt which can periodically cause the computer to stop executing instructions where it was and do something else instead by remembering where it was executing prior to the interrupt the computer can return to that task later if several programs are running at the same time then the interrupt generator might be causing several hundred interrupts per second causing a program switch each time since modern computers typically execute instructions several orders of magnitude faster than human perception it may appear that many programs are running at the same time even though only one is ever executing in any given instant this method of multitasking is sometimes termed timesharing since each program is allocated a slice of time in turn before the era of inexpensive computers the principal use for multitasking was to allow many people to share the same computer seemingly multitasking would cause a computer that is switching between several programs to run more slowly in direct proportion to the number of programs it is running but most programs spend much of their time waiting for slow inputoutput devices to complete their tasks if a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard then it will not take a time slice until the event it is waiting for has occurred this frees up time for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run simultaneously without unacceptable speed loss multiprocessing some computers are designed to distribute their work across several cpus in a multiprocessing configuration a technique once employed in only large and powerful machines such as supercomputers mainframe computers and servers multiprocessor and multicore multiple cpus on a single integrated circuit personal and laptop computers are now widely available and are being increasingly used in lowerend markets as a result supercomputers in particular often have highly unique architectures that differ significantly from the basic storedprogram architecture and from generalpurpose computers they often feature thousands of cpus customized highspeed interconnects and specialized computing hardware such designs tend to be useful for only specialized tasks due to the large scale of program organization required to use most of the available resources at once supercomputers usually see usage in largescale simulation graphics rendering and cryptography applications as well as with other socalled embarrassingly parallel tasks software software is the part of a computer system that consists of the encoded information that determines the computers operation such as data or instructions on how to process the data in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built software is immaterial software includes computer programs libraries and related nonexecutable data such as online documentation or digital media it is often divided into system software and application software computer hardware and software require each other and neither is useful on its own when software is stored in hardware that cannot easily be modified such as with bios rom in an ibm pc compatible computer it is sometimes called firmware programs the defining feature of modern computers which distinguishes them from all other machines is that they can be programmed that is to say that some type of instructions the program can be given to the computer and it will process them modern computers based on the von neumann architecture often have machine code in the form of an imperative programming language in practical terms a computer program may be just a few instructions or extend to many millions of instructions as do the programs for word processors and web browsers for example a typical modern computer can execute billions of instructions per second gigaflops and rarely makes a mistake over many years of operation large computer programs consisting of several million instructions may take teams of programmers years to write and due to the complexity of the task almost certainly contain errors stored program architecture this section applies to most common ram machinebased computers in most cases computer instructions are simple add one number to another move some data from one location to another send a message to some external device etc these instructions are read from the computers memory and are generally carried out executed in the order they were given however there are usually specialized instructions to tell the computer to jump ahead or backwards to some other place in the program and to carry on executing from there these are called jump instructions or branches furthermore jump instructions may be made to happen conditionally so that different sequences of instructions may be used depending on the result of some previous calculation or some external event many computers directly support subroutines by providing a type of jump that remembers the location it jumped from and another instruction to return to the instruction following that jump instruction program execution might be likened to reading a book while a person will normally read each word and line in sequence they may at times jump back to an earlier place in the text or skip sections that are not of interest similarly a computer may sometimes go back and repeat the instructions in some section of the program over and over again until some internal condition is met this is called the flow of control within the program and it is what allows the computer to perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention comparatively a person using a pocket calculator can perform a basic arithmetic operation such as adding two numbers with just a few button presses but to add together all of the numbers from  to  would take thousands of button presses and a lot of time with a near certainty of making a mistake on the other hand a computer may be programmed to do this with just a few simple instructions the following example is written in the mips assembly language once told to run this program the computer will perform the repetitive addition task without further human intervention it will almost never make a mistake and a modern pc can complete the task in a fraction of a second machine code in most computers individual instructions are stored as machine code with each instruction being given a unique number its operation code or opcode for short the command to add two numbers together would have one opcode the command to multiply them would have a different opcode and so on the simplest computers are able to perform any of a handful of different instructions the more complex computers have several hundred to choose from each with a unique numerical code since the computers memory is able to store numbers it can also store the instruction codes this leads to the important fact that entire programs which are just lists of these instructions can be represented as lists of numbers and can themselves be manipulated inside the computer in the same way as numeric data the fundamental concept of storing programs in the computers memory alongside the data they operate on is the crux of the von neumann or stored program architecture in some cases a computer might store some or all of its program in memory that is kept separate from the data it operates on this is called the harvard architecture after the harvard mark i computer modern von neumann computers display some traits of the harvard architecture in their designs such as in cpu caches while it is possible to write computer programs as long lists of numbers machine language and while this technique was used with many early computers it is extremely tedious and potentially errorprone to do so in practice especially for complicated programs instead each basic instruction can be given a short name that is indicative of its function and easy to remember  a mnemonic such as add sub mult or jump these mnemonics are collectively known as a computers assembly language converting programs written in assembly language into something the computer can actually understand machine language is usually done by a computer program called an assembler programming language a programming language is a notation system for writing the source code from which a computer program is produced programming languages provide various ways of specifying programs for computers to run unlike natural languages programming languages are designed to permit no ambiguity and to be concise they are purely written languages and are often difficult to read aloud they are generally either translated into machine code by a compiler or an assembler before being run or translated directly at run time by an interpreter sometimes programs are executed by a hybrid method of the two techniques there are thousands of programming languagessome intended for general purpose programming others useful for only highly specialized applications lowlevel languages machine languages and the assembly languages that represent them collectively termed lowlevel programming languages are generally unique to the particular architecture of a computers central processing unit cpu for instance an arm architecture cpu such as may be found in a smartphone or a handheld videogame cannot understand the machine language of an x cpu that might be in a pc historically a significant number of other cpu architectures were created and saw extensive use notably including the mos technology  and  in addition to the zilog z highlevel languages although considerably easier than in machine language writing long programs in assembly language is often difficult and is also error prone therefore most practical programs are written in more abstract highlevel programming languages that are able to express the needs of the programmer more conveniently and thereby help reduce programmer error high level languages are usually compiled into machine language or sometimes into assembly language and then into machine language using another computer program called a compiler high level languages are less related to the workings of the target computer than assembly language and more related to the language and structure of the problems to be solved by the final program it is therefore often possible to use different compilers to translate the same high level language program into the machine language of many different types of computer this is part of the means by which software like video games may be made available for different computer architectures such as personal computers and various video game consoles program design program design of small programs is relatively simple and involves the analysis of the problem collection of inputs using the programming constructs within languages devising or using established procedures and algorithms providing data for output devices and solutions to the problem as applicable as problems become larger and more complex features such as subprograms modules formal documentation and new paradigms such as objectoriented programming are encountered large programs involving thousands of line of code and more require formal software methodologies the task of developing large software systems presents a significant intellectual challenge producing software with an acceptably high reliability within a predictable schedule and budget has historically been difficult the academic and professional discipline of software engineering concentrates specifically on this challenge bugs errors in computer programs are called bugs they may be benign and not affect the usefulness of the program or have only subtle effects however in some cases they may cause the program or the entire system to hang becoming unresponsive to input such as mouse clicks or keystrokes to completely fail or to crash otherwise benign bugs may sometimes be harnessed for malicious intent by an unscrupulous user writing an exploit code designed to take advantage of a bug and disrupt a computers proper execution bugs are usually not the fault of the computer since computers merely execute the instructions they are given bugs are nearly always the result of programmer error or an oversight made in the programs design admiral grace hopper an american computer scientist and developer of the first compiler is credited for having first used the term bugs in computing after a dead moth was found shorting a relay in the harvard mark ii computer in september  networking and the internet computers have been used to coordinate information between multiple physical locations since the s the us militarys sage system was the first largescale example of such a system which led to a number of specialpurpose commercial systems such as sabre in the s computer engineers at research institutions throughout the united states began to link their computers together using telecommunications technology the effort was funded by arpa now darpa and the computer network that resulted was called the arpanet logic gates are a common abstraction which can apply to most of the above digital or analog paradigms the ability to store and execute lists of instructions called programs makes computers extremely versatile distinguishing them from calculators the churchturing thesis is a mathematical statement of this versatility any computer with a minimum capability being turingcomplete is in principle capable of performing the same tasks that any other computer can perform therefore any type of computer netbook supercomputer cellular automaton etc is able to perform the same computational tasks given enough time and storage capacity artificial intelligence in the th century artificial intelligence systems were predominantly symbolic they executed code that was explicitly programmed by software developers machine learning models however have a set parameters that are adjusted throughout training so that the model learns to accomplish a task based on the provided data the efficiency of machine learning and in particular of neural networks has rapidly improved with progress in hardware for parallel computing mainly graphics processing units gpus some large language models are able to control computers or robots ai progress may lead to the creation of artificial general intelligence agi a type of ai that could accomplish virtually any intellectual task at least as well as humans professions and organizations as the use of computers has spread throughout society there are an increasing number of careers involving computers the need for computers to work well together and to be able to exchange information has spawned the need for many standards organizations clubs and societies of both a formal and informal nature see also notes references sources external links media related to computers at wikimedia commons wikiversity has a
