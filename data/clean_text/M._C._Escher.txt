maurits cornelis escher  dutch murts krnels r  june    march  was a dutch graphic artist who made woodcuts lithographs and mezzotints many of which were inspired by mathematics despite wide popular interest for most of his life escher was neglected in the art world even in his native netherlands he was  before a retrospective exhibition was held in the late twentieth century he became more widely appreciated and in the twentyfirst century he has been celebrated in exhibitions around the world his work features mathematical objects and operations including impossible objects explorations of infinity reflection symmetry perspective truncated and stellated polyhedra hyperbolic geometry and tessellations although escher believed he had no mathematical ability he interacted with the mathematicians george polya roger penrose and donald coxeter and the crystallographer friedrich haag and conducted his own research into tessellation early in his career he drew inspiration from nature making studies of insects landscapes and plants such as lichens all of which he used as details in his artworks he traveled in italy and spain sketching buildings townscapes architecture and the tilings of the alhambra and the mezquita of cordoba and became steadily more interested in their mathematical structure eschers art became well known among scientists and mathematicians and in popular culture especially after it was featured by martin gardner in his april  mathematical games column in scientific american apart from being used in a variety of technical papers his work has appeared on the covers of many books and albums he was one of the major inspirations for douglas hofstadters pulitzer prizewinning  book godel escher bach early life maurits cornelis escher was born on  june  in leeuwarden friesland the netherlands in a house that forms part of the princessehof ceramics museum today he was the youngest son of the civil engineer george arnold escher and his second wife sara gleichman in  the family moved to arnhem where he attended primary and secondary school until  known to his friends and family as mauk he was a sickly child and was placed in a special school at the age of seven he failed the second grade although he excelled at drawing his grades were generally poor he took carpentry and piano lessons until he was thirteen years old in  he went to the technical college of delft from  to  escher attended the haarlem school of architecture and decorative arts learning drawing and the art of making woodcuts he briefly studied architecture but he failed a number of subjects due partly to a persistent skin infection and switched to decorative arts studying under the graphic artist samuel jessurun de mesquita study journeys in  an important year of his life escher traveled through italy visiting florence san gimignano volterra siena and ravello in the same year he traveled through spain visiting madrid toledo and granada he was impressed by the italian countryside and in granada by the moorish architecture of the fourteenthcentury alhambra the intricate decorative designs of the alhambra based on geometrical symmetries featuring interlocking repetitive patterns in the coloured tiles or sculpted into the walls and ceilings triggered his interest in the mathematics of tessellation and became a powerful influence on his work escher returned to italy and lived in rome from  to  while in italy escher met jetta umiker  a swiss woman like himself attracted to italy  whom he married in  the couple settled in rome where their first son giorgio george arnaldo escher named after his grandfather was born escher and jetta later had two more sons  arthur and jan he travelled frequently visiting among other places viterbo in  the abruzzi in  and  corsica in  and  calabria in  the amalfi coast in  and  and gargano and sicily in  and  the townscapes and landscapes of these places feature prominently in his artworks in may and june  escher travelled back to spain revisiting the alhambra and spending days at a time making detailed drawings of its mosaic patterns it was here that he became fascinated to the point of obsession with tessellation explaining it remains an extremely absorbing activity a real mania to which i have become addicted and from which i sometimes find it hard to tear myself away the sketches he made in the alhambra formed a major source for his work from that time on he studied the architecture of the mezquita the moorish mosque of cordoba this turned out to be the last of his long study journeys after  his artworks were created in his studio rather than in the field his art correspondingly changed sharply from being mainly observational with a strong emphasis on the realistic details of things seen in nature and architecture to being the product of his geometric analysis and his visual imagination all the same even his early work already shows his interest in the nature of space the unusual perspective and multiple points of view later life in  the political climate in italy under mussolini became unacceptable to escher he had no interest in politics finding it impossible to involve himself with any ideals other than the expressions of his own concepts through his own particular medium but he was averse to fanaticism and hypocrisy when his eldest son george was forced at the age of nine to wear a ballila uniform in school the family left italy and moved to chateaudx switzerland where they remained for two years the netherlands post office had escher design a semipostal stamp for the air fund dutch het nationaal luchtvaartfonds in  and again in  he designed dutch stamps these were for the th anniversary of the universal postal union a different design was used by suriname and the netherlands antilles for the same commemoration escher who had been very fond of and inspired by the landscapes in italy was decidedly unhappy in switzerland in  the family moved again to uccle ukkel a suburb of brussels belgium world war ii forced them to move in january  this time to baarn netherlands where escher lived until  most of eschers bestknown works date from this period the sometimes cloudy cold and wet weather of the netherlands allowed him to focus intently on his work after  escher lectured widely a planned series of lectures in north america in  was cancelled after an illness and he stopped creating artworks for a time but the illustrations and text for the lectures were later published as part of the book escher on escher he was awarded the knighthood of the order of orangenassau in  in  he was made an officer in july  he finished his last work a large woodcut with threefold rotational symmetry called snakes in which snakes wind through a pattern of linked rings these shrink to infinity toward both the center and the edge of a circle it was exceptionally elaborate being printed using three blocks each rotated three times about the center of the image and precisely aligned to avoid gaps and overlaps for a total of nine print operations for each finished print the image encapsulates eschers love of symmetry of interlocking patterns and at the end of his life of his approach to infinity the care that escher took in creating and printing this woodcut can be seen in a video recording escher moved to the rosa spier huis in laren in  an artists retirement home in which he had his own studio he died in a hospital in hilversum on  march  aged  he is buried at the new cemetery in baarn mathematically inspired work much of eschers work is inescapably mathematical this has caused a disconnect between his fame among mathematicians and the general public and the lack of esteem with which he has been viewed in the art world his originality and mastery of graphic techniques are respected but his works have been thought too intellectual and insufficiently lyrical movements such as conceptual art have to a degree reversed the art worlds attitude to intellectuality and lyricism but this did not rehabilitate escher because traditional critics still disliked his narrative themes and his use of perspective however these same qualities made his work highly attractive to the public escher is not the first artist to explore mathematical themes j l locher a previous director of the kunstmuseum in the hague pointed out that parmigianino  had explored spherical geometry and reflection in his  selfportrait in a convex mirror depicting his own image in a curved mirror while william hogarths  satire on false perspective foreshadows eschers playful exploration of errors in perspective another early artistic forerunner is giovanni battista piranesi  whose dark fantastical prints such as the drawbridge in his carceri prisons sequence depict perspectives of complex architecture with many stairs and ramps peopled by walking figures escher greatly admired piranesi and had several of piranesis prints hanging in his studio only with th century movements such as cubism de stijl dadaism and surrealism did mainstream art start to explore escherlike ways of looking at the world with multiple simultaneous viewpoints however although escher had much in common with for example magrittes surrealism and op art he did not make contact with any of these movements tessellation in his early years escher sketched landscapes and nature he sketched insects such as ants bees grasshoppers and mantises which appeared frequently in his later work his early love of roman and italian landscapes and of nature created an interest in tessellation which he called regular division of the plane this became the title of his  book complete with reproductions of a series of woodcuts based on tessellations of the plane in which he described the systematic buildup of mathematical designs in his artworks he wrote crystallographers have opened the gate leading to an extensive domain after his  journey to the alhambra and to la mezquita cordoba where he sketched the moorish architecture and the tessellated mosaic decorations escher began to explore tessellation using geometric grids as the basis for his sketches he then extended these to form complex interlocking designs for example with animals such as birds fish and reptiles one of his first attempts at a tessellation was his pencil india ink and watercolour study of regular division of the plane with reptiles  constructed on a hexagonal grid the heads of the red green and white reptiles meet at a vertex the tails legs and sides of the animals interlock exactly it was used as the basis for his  lithograph reptiles his first study of mathematics began with papers by george polya and by the crystallographer friedrich haag on plane symmetry groups sent to him by his brother berend a geologist he carefully studied the  canonical wallpaper groups and created periodic tilings with  drawings of different types of symmetry from this point on he developed a mathematical approach to expressions of symmetry in his artworks using his own notation starting in  he created woodcuts based on the  groups his metamorphosis i  began a series of designs that told a story through the use of pictures in metamorphosis i he transformed convex polygons into regular patterns in a plane to form a human motif he extended the approach in his piece metamorphosis iii which is almost seven metres long in  and  escher summarised his findings for his own artistic use in a sketchbook which he labeled following haag regelmatige vlakverdeling in asymmetrische congruente veelhoeken regular division of the plane with asymmetric congruent polygons the mathematician doris schattschneider unequivocally described this notebook as recording a methodical investigation that can only be termed mathematical research she defined the research questions he was following as  what are the possible shapes for a tile that can produce a regular division of the plane that is a tile that can fill the plane with its congruent images such that every tile is surrounded in the same manner moreover in what ways are the edges of such a tile related to each other by isometries geometries although escher did not have mathematical training  his understanding of mathematics was largely visual and intuitive  his art had a strong mathematical component and several of the worlds that he drew were built around impossible objects after  escher turned to sketching landscapes in italy and corsica with irregular perspectives that are impossible in natural form his first print of an impossible reality was still life and street  impossible stairs and multiple visual and gravitational perspectives feature in popular works such as relativity  house of stairs  attracted the interest of the mathematician roger penrose and his father the biologist lionel penrose in  they published a paper impossible objects a special type of visual illusion and later sent escher a copy escher replied admiring the penroses continuously rising flights of steps and enclosed a print of ascending and descending  the paper contained the tribar or penrose triangle which escher used repeatedly in his lithograph of a building that appears to function as a perpetual motion machine waterfall  escher was interested enough in hieronymus boschs  triptych the garden of earthly delights to recreate part of its righthand panel hell as a lithograph in  he reused the figure of a mediaeval woman in a twopointed headdress and a long gown in his lithograph belvedere in  the image is like many of his other extraordinary invented places peopled with jesters knaves and contemplators thus escher not only was interested in possible or impossible geometry but was in his own words a reality enthusiast he combined formal astonishment with a vivid and idiosyncratic vision escher worked primarily in the media of lithographs and woodcuts although the few mezzotints he made are considered to be masterpieces of the technique in his graphic art he portrayed mathematical relationships among shapes figures and space integrated into his prints were mirror images of cones spheres cubes rings and spirals escher was fascinated by mathematical objects such as the mobius strip which has only one surface his wood engraving mobius strip ii  depicts a chain of ants marching forever over what at any one place are the two opposite faces of the objectwhich are seen on inspection to be parts of the strips single surface in eschers own words an endless ringshaped band usually has two distinct surfaces one inside and one outside yet on this strip nine red ants crawl after each other and travel the front side as well as the reverse side therefore the strip has only one surface the mathematical influence in his work became prominent after  when having boldly asked the adria shipping company if he could sail with them as travelling artist in return for making drawings of their ships they surprisingly agreed and he sailed the mediterranean becoming interested in order and symmetry escher described this journey including his repeat visit to the alhambra as the richest source of inspiration i have ever tapped eschers interest in curvilinear perspective was encouraged by his friend and kindred spirit the art historian and artist albert flocon in another example of constructive mutual influence flocon identified escher as a thinking artist alongside piero della francesca leonardo da vinci albrecht durer wenzel jamnitzer abraham bosse girard desargues and pere nicon flocon was delighted by eschers grafiek en tekeningen graphics and drawings which he read in  this stimulated flocon and andre barre to correspond with escher and to write the book la perspective curviligne curvilinear perspective platonic and other solids escher often incorporated threedimensional objects such as the platonic solids such as spheres tetrahedrons and cubes into his works as well as mathematical objects such as cylinders and stellated polyhedra in the print reptiles he combined two and threedimensional images in one of his papers escher emphasized the importance of dimensionality the flat shape irritates me  i feel like telling my objects you are too fictitious lying there next to each other static and frozen do something come off the paper and show me what you are capable of  so i make them come out of the plane  my objects  may finally return to the plane and disappear into their place of origin eschers artwork is especially wellliked by mathematicians such as doris schattschneider and scientists such as roger penrose who enjoy his use of polyhedra and geometric distortions for example in gravitation animals climb around a stellated dodecahedron the two towers of waterfalls impossible building are topped with compound polyhedra one a compound of three cubes the other a stellated rhombic dodecahedron now known as eschers solid escher had used this solid in his  woodcut stars which contains all five of the platonic solids and various stellated solids representing stars the central solid is animated by chameleons climbing through the frame as it whirls in space escher possessed a  cm refracting telescope and was a keenenough amateur astronomer to have recorded observations of binary stars levels of reality eschers artistic expression was created from images in his mind rather than directly from observations and travels to other countries his interest in the multiple levels of reality in art is seen in works such as drawing hands  where two hands are shown each drawing the other the critic steven poole commented that it is a neat depiction of one of eschers enduring fascinations the contrast between the twodimensional flatness of a sheet of paper and the illusion of threedimensional volume that can be created with certain marks in drawing hands space and the flat plane coexist each born from and returning to the other the black magic of the artistic illusion made creepily manifest infinity and hyperbolic geometry in  the international congress of mathematicians met in amsterdam and n g de bruin organised a display of eschers work at the stedelijk museum for the participants both roger penrose and h s m coxeter were deeply impressed with eschers intuitive grasp of mathematics inspired by relativity penrose devised his tribar and his father lionel penrose devised an endless staircase roger penrose sent sketches of both objects to escher and the cycle of invention was closed when escher then created the perpetual motion machine of waterfall and the endless march of the monkfigures of ascending and descending in  coxeter obtained eschers permission to use two of his drawings in his paper crystal symmetry and its generalizations he sent escher a copy of the paper escher recorded that coxeters figure of a hyperbolic tessellation gave me quite a shock the infinite regular repetition of the tiles in the hyperbolic plane growing rapidly smaller towards the edge of the circle was precisely what he wanted to allow him to represent infinity on a twodimensional plane escher carefully studied coxeters figure marking it up to analyse the successively smaller circles with which he deduced it had been constructed he then constructed a diagram which he sent to coxeter showing his analysis coxeter confirmed it was correct but disappointed escher with his highly technical reply all the same escher persisted with hyperbolic tiling which he called coxetering among the results were the series of wood engravings circle limit iiv in  coxeter published his finding that these works were extraordinarily accurate escher got it absolutely right to the millimeter legacy in art collections the escher intellectual property is controlled by the mc escher company while exhibitions of his artworks are managed separately by the mc escher foundation the primary institutional collections of original works by mc escher are exhibited at the escher museum in the hague which are part of the large collection of the kunstmuseum there the national gallery of art washington dc the national gallery of canada ottawa the israel museum jerusalem and the huis ten bosch nagasaki japan exhibitions despite wide popular interest escher was for a long time somewhat neglected in the art world even in his native netherlands he was  before a retrospective exhibition was held in the twentyfirst century major exhibitions have been held in cities around the world an exhibition of his work in rio de janeiro attracted more than  visitors in  its daily visitor count of  made it the most visited museum exhibition of the year anywhere in the world no major exhibition of eschers work was held in britain until  when the scottish national gallery of modern art ran one in edinburgh from june to september  moving in october  to the dulwich picture gallery london the exhibition poster is based on hand with reflecting sphere  which shows escher in his house reflected in a handheld sphere thus illustrating the artist his interest in levels of reality in art eg is the hand in the foreground more real than the reflected one perspective and spherical geometry the exhibition moved to italy in  attracting over  visitors in rome and bologna and then milan in  the kunstmuseum in the hague created a large retrospective of escher entitled escher  other world in mathematics and science doris schattschneider identifies eleven strands of mathematical and scientific research anticipated or directly inspired by escher these are the classification of regular tilings using the edge relationships of tiles twocolor and twomotif tilings counterchange symmetry or antisymmetry color symmetry in crystallography metamorphosis or topological change covering surfaces with symmetric patterns eschers algorithm for generating patterns using decorated squares creating tile shapes local versus global definitions of regularity symmetry of a tiling induced by the symmetry of a tile orderliness not induced by symmetry groups the filling of the central void in eschers lithograph print gallery by h lenstra and b de
