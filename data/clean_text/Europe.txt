europe is a continent located entirely in the northern hemisphere and mostly in the eastern hemisphere it is bordered by the arctic ocean to the north the atlantic ocean to the west the mediterranean sea to the south and asia to the east europe shares the landmass of eurasia with asia and of afroeurasia with both africa and asia europe is commonly considered to be separated from asia by the watershed of the ural mountains the ural river the caspian sea the greater caucasus the black sea and the turkish straits europe covers approx  square kilometres  sq mi or  of earths surface  of earths land area making it the secondsmallest continent using the sevencontinent model politically europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states of which russia is the largest and most populous spanning  of the continent and comprising  of its population europe had a total population of about  million about  of the world population in  the thirdlargest after asia and africa the european climate is affected by warm atlantic currents such as the gulf stream which produce a temperate climate tempering winters and summers on much of the continent further from the sea seasonal differences are more noticeable producing more continental climates the culture of europe consists of a range of national and regional cultures which form the central roots of the wider western civilisation and together commonly reference ancient greece and ancient rome particularly through their christian successors as crucial and shared roots beginning with the fall of the western roman empire in  ce christian consolidation of europe in the wake of the migration period marked the european postclassical middle ages the italian renaissance spread across many western european countries adapting to local contexts and giving rise to distinct national expressions the renewed humanist emphasis on art and science was among the several factors that contributed to the broader transition to the modern era since the age of discovery led by spain and portugal europe played a predominant role in global affairs with multiple explorations and conquests around the world between the th and th centuries european powers colonised at various times the americas almost all of africa and oceania and the majority of asia the age of enlightenment the french revolution and the napoleonic wars shaped the continent culturally politically and economically from the end of the th century until the first half of the th century the industrial revolution which began in great britain at the end of the th century gave rise to radical economic cultural and social change in western europe and eventually the wider world both world wars began and were fought to a great extent in europe contributing to a decline in western european dominance in world affairs by the midth century as the soviet union and the united states took prominence and competed over ideological dominance and international influence in europe and globally the resulting cold war divided europe along the iron curtain with nato in the west and the warsaw pact in the east this divide ended with the revolutions of  the fall of the berlin wall and the dissolution of the soviet union which allowed european integration to advance significantly european integration has been advanced institutionally since  with the founding of the council of europe and significantly through the realisation of the european union eu which represents today the majority of europe the european union is a supranational political entity that lies between a confederation and a federation and is based on a system of european treaties the eu originated in western europe but has been expanding eastward since the dissolution of the soviet union in  a majority of its members have adopted a common currency the euro and participate in the european single market and a customs union a large bloc of countries the schengen area have also abolished internal border and immigration controls regular popular elections take place every five years within the eu they are considered the secondlargest democratic elections in the world after indias the eu economy is the secondlargest in the world by nominal gdp and thirdlargest by pppadjusted gdp etymology in classical greek mythology europa ancient greek  europe was a phoenician princess one view is that her name derives from the ancient greek elements  eurus wide broad and  ops gen  opos eye face countenance hence their composite europe would mean widegazing or broad of aspect broad has been an epithet of earth herself in the reconstructed protoindoeuropean religion and the poetry devoted to it an alternative view is that of robert beekes who has argued in favour of a preindoeuropean origin for the name explaining that a derivation from eurus would yield a different toponym than europa beekes has located toponyms related to that of europa in the territory of ancient greece and localities such as that of europos in ancient macedonia there have been attempts to connect europe to a semitic term for west this being either akkadian erebu meaning to go down set said of the sun or phoenician ereb evening west which is at the origin of arabic maghreb and hebrew maarav martin litchfield west stated that phonologically the match between europas name and any form of the semitic word is very poor while beekes considers a connection to semitic languages improbable most major world languages use words derived from europe or europa to refer to the continent chinese for example uses the word ouzhou  which is an abbreviation of the transliterated name ouluoba zhou  zhou means continent a similar chinesederived term oshu  is also sometimes used in japanese such as in the japanese name of the european union oshu rengo  despite the katakana yoroppa  being more commonly used in some turkic languages the originally persian name frangistan land of the franks is used casually in referring to much of europe besides official names such as avrupa or evropa definition contemporary definition the prevalent definition of europe as a geographical term has been in use since the midth century europe is taken to be bounded by large bodies of water to the north west and south europes limits to the east and northeast are usually taken to be the ural mountains the ural river and the caspian sea to the southeast the caucasus mountains the black sea and the waterways connecting the black sea to the mediterranean sea islands are generally grouped with the nearest continental landmass hence iceland is considered to be part of europe while the nearby island of greenland is usually assigned to north america although politically belonging to denmark nevertheless there are some exceptions based on sociopolitical and cultural differences cyprus is closest to anatolia or asia minor but is considered part of europe politically and it is a member state of the eu malta was considered an island of northwestern africa for centuries but now it is considered to be part of europe as well europe as used specifically in british english may also refer to continental europe exclusively the term continent usually implies the physical geography of a large land mass completely or almost completely surrounded by water at its borders prior to the adoption of the current convention that includes mountain divides the border between europe and asia had been redefined several times since its first conception in classical antiquity but always as a series of rivers seas and straits that were believed to extend an unknown distance east and north from the mediterranean sea without the inclusion of any mountain ranges cartographer herman moll suggested in  europe was bounded by a series of partly joined waterways directed towards the turkish straits and the irtysh river draining into the upper part of the ob river and the arctic ocean in contrast the present eastern boundary of europe partially adheres to the ural and caucasus mountains which is somewhat arbitrary and inconsistent compared to any clearcut definition of the term continent the current division of eurasia into two continents now reflects eastwest cultural linguistic and ethnic differences which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line the geographic border between europe and asia does not follow any state boundaries and now only follows a few bodies of water turkey is generally considered a transcontinental country divided entirely by water while russia and kazakhstan are only partly divided by waterways france the netherlands portugal and spain are also transcontinental or more properly intercontinental when oceans or large seas are involved in that their main land areas are in europe while pockets of their territories are located on other continents separated from europe by large bodies of water spain for example has territories south of the mediterranean seanamely ceuta and melillawhich are parts of africa and share a border with morocco according to the current convention georgia and azerbaijan are transcontinental countries where waterways have been completely replaced by mountains as the divide between continents history of the concept early history the first recorded usage of europe as a geographic term is in the homeric hymn to delian apollo in reference to the western shore of the aegean sea as a name for a part of the known world it is first used in the th century bce by anaximander and hecataeus anaximander placed the boundary between asia and europe along the phasis river the modern rioni river on the territory of georgia in the caucasus a convention still followed by herodotus in the th century bce herodotus mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three partseurope asia and libya africawith the nile and the phasis forming their boundariesthough he also states that some considered the river don rather than the phasis as the boundary between europe and asia europes eastern frontier was defined in the st century by geographer strabo at the river don the book of jubilees described the continents as the lands given by noah to his three sons europe was defined as stretching from the pillars of hercules at the strait of gibraltar separating it from northwest africa to the don separating it from asia the convention received by the middle ages and surviving into modern usage is that of the roman era used by romanera authors such as posidonius strabo and ptolemy who took the tanais the modern don river as the boundary the roman empire did not attach a strong identity to the concept of continental divisions however following the fall of the western roman empire the culture that developed in its place linked to latin and the catholic church began to associate itself with the concept of europe the term europe is first used for a cultural sphere in the carolingian renaissance of the th century from that time the term designated the sphere of influence of the western church as opposed to both the eastern orthodox churches and to the islamic world a cultural definition of europe as the lands of latin christendom coalesced in the th century signifying the new cultural condominium created through the confluence of germanic traditions and christianlatin culture defined partly in contrast with byzantium and islam and limited to northern iberia the british isles france christianised western germany the alpine regions and northern and central italy the concept is one of the lasting legacies of the carolingian renaissance europa often figures in the letters of charlemagnes court scholar alcuin the transition of europe to being a cultural term as well as a geographic one led to the borders of europe being affected by cultural considerations in the east especially relating to areas under byzantine ottoman and russian influence such questions were affected by the positive connotations associated with the term europe by its users such cultural considerations were not applied to the americas despite their conquest and settlement by european states instead the concept of western civilisation emerged as a way of grouping together europe and these colonies modern definitions the question of defining a precise eastern boundary of europe arises in the early modern period as the eastern extension of muscovy began to include north asia throughout the middle ages and into the th century the traditional division of the landmass of eurasia into two continents europe and asia followed ptolemy with the boundary following the turkish straits the black sea the kerch strait the sea of azov and the don ancient tanais but maps produced during the th to th centuries tended to differ in how to continue the boundary beyond the don bend at kalachnadonu where it is closest to the volga now joined with it by the volgadon canal into territory not described in any detail by the ancient geographers around  herman moll produced a map showing the northern part of the ob river and the irtysh river a major tributary of the ob as components of a series of partly joined waterways taking the boundary between europe and asia from the turkish straits and the don river all the way to the arctic ocean in  he produced a more up to date map that was easier to read however his proposal to adhere to major rivers as the line of demarcation was never taken up by other geographers who were beginning to move away from the idea of water boundaries as the only legitimate divides between europe and asia four years later in  philip johan von strahlenberg was the first to depart from the classical don boundary he drew a new line along the volga following the volga north until the samara bend along obshchy syrt the drainage divide between the volga and ural rivers then north and east along the latter waterway to its source in the ural mountains at this point he proposed that mountain ranges could be included as boundaries between continents as alternatives to nearby waterways accordingly he drew the new boundary north along ural mountains rather than the nearby and parallel running ob and irtysh rivers this was endorsed by the russian empire and introduced the convention that would eventually become commonly accepted however this did not come without criticism voltaire writing in  about peter the greats efforts to make russia more european ignored the whole boundary question with his claim that neither russia scandinavia northern germany nor poland were fully part of europe since then many modern analytical geographers like halford mackinder have declared that they see little validity in the ural mountains as a boundary between continents the mapmakers continued to differ on the boundary between the lower don and samara well into the th century the  atlas published by the russian academy of sciences has the boundary follow the don beyond kalach as far as serafimovich before cutting north towards arkhangelsk while other th to thcentury mapmakers such as john cary followed strahlenbergs prescription to the south the kumamanych depression was identified c  by a german naturalist peter simon pallas as a valley that once connected the black sea and the caspian sea and subsequently was proposed as a natural boundary between continents by the midth century there were three main conventions one following the don the volgadon canal and the volga the other following the kumamanych depression to the caspian and then the ural river and the third abandoning the don altogether following the greater caucasus watershed to the caspian the question was still treated as a controversy in geographical literature of the s with douglas freshfield advocating the caucasus crest boundary as the best possible citing support from various modern geographers in russia and the soviet union the boundary along the kumamanych depression was the most commonly used as early as  in  the soviet geographical society formally recommended that the boundary between the europe and asia be drawn in textbooks from baydaratskaya bay on the kara sea along the eastern foot of ural mountains then following the ural river until the mugodzhar hills and then the emba river and kumamanych depression thus placing the caucasus entirely in asia and the urals entirely in europe the flora europaea adopted a boundary along the terek and kuban rivers so southwards from the kuma and the manych but still with the caucasus entirely in asia however most geographers in the soviet union favoured the boundary along the caucasus crest and this became the common convention in the later th century although the kumamanych boundary remained in use in some thcentury maps some view the separation of eurasia into asia and europe as a residue of eurocentrism in physical cultural and historical diversity china and india are comparable to the entire european landmass not to a single european country  history prehistory during the  million years of the pleistocene numerous cold phases called glacials quaternary ice age or significant advances of continental ice sheets in europe and north america occurred at intervals of approximately  to  years the long glacial periods were separated by more temperate and shorter interglacials which lasted about  years the last cold episode of the last glacial period ended about  years ago earth is currently in an interglacial period of the quaternary called the holocene homo erectus georgicus which lived roughly  million years ago in georgia is the earliest hominin to have been discovered in europe other hominin remains dating back roughly  million years have been discovered in atapuerca spain neanderthal man named after the neandertal valley in germany appeared in europe  years ago  years ago it is found already in the territory of presentday poland and disappeared from the fossil record about  years ago with their final refuge being the iberian peninsula the neanderthals were supplanted by modern humans cromagnons who seem to have appeared in europe around  to  years ago however there is also evidence that homo sapiens arrived in europe around  years ago some  years earlier than previously thought the earliest sites in europe dated  years ago are riparo mochi italy geissenklosterle germany and isturitz france the european neolithic periodmarked by the cultivation of crops and the raising of livestock increased numbers of settlements and the widespread use of potterybegan around  bce in greece and the balkans probably influenced by earlier farming practices in anatolia and the near east it spread from the balkans along the valleys of the danube and the rhine linear pottery culture and along the mediterranean coast cardial culture between  and  bce these central european neolithic cultures developed further to the west and the north transmitting newly acquired skills in producing copper artifacts in western europe the neolithic period was characterised not by large agricultural settlements but by field monuments such as causewayed enclosures burial mounds and megalithic tombs the corded ware cultural horizon flourished at the transition from the neolithic to the chalcolithic during this period giant megalithic monuments such as the megalithic temples of malta and stonehenge were constructed throughout western and southern europe the modern native populations of europe largely descend from three distinct lineages mesolithic huntergatherers descended from populations associated with the paleolithic epigravettian culture neolithic early european farmers who migrated from anatolia during the neolithic revolution  years ago and yamnaya steppe herders who expanded into europe from the ponticcaspian steppe of ukraine and southern russia in the context of indoeuropean migrations  years ago the european bronze age began c  bce in greece with the minoan civilisation on crete the first advanced civilisation in europe the minoans were followed by the myceneans who collapsed suddenly around  bce ushering the european iron age iron age colonisation by the greeks and phoenicians gave rise to early mediterranean cities early iron age italy and greece from around the th century bce gradually gave rise to historical classical antiquity whose beginning is sometimes dated to  bce the year of the first olympic games classical antiquity ancient greece was the founding culture of western civilisation western democratic and rationalist culture are often attributed to ancient greece the greek citystate the polis was the fundamental political unit of classical greece in  bce cleisthenes instituted the worlds first democratic system of government in athens the greek political ideals were rediscovered in the late th century by european philosophers and idealists greece also generated many cultural contributions in philosophy humanism and rationalism under aristotle socrates and plato in history with herodotus and thucydides in dramatic and narrative verse starting with the epic poems of homer in drama with sophocles and euripides in medicine with hippocrates and galen and in science with pythagoras euclid and archimedes in the course of the th century bce several of the greek city states would ultimately check the achaemenid persian advance in europe through the grecopersian wars considered a pivotal moment in world history as the  years of peace that followed are known as golden age of athens the seminal period of ancient greece that laid many of the foundations of western civilisation greece was followed by rome which left its mark on law politics language engineering architecture government and many more key aspects in western civilisation by  bce rome had conquered italy and over the following two centuries it conquered greece hispania spain and portugal the north african coast much of the middle east gaul france and belgium and britannia england and wales expanding from their base in central italy beginning in the third century bce the romans gradually expanded to eventually rule the entire mediterranean basin and western europe by the turn of the millennium the roman republic ended in  bce when augustus proclaimed the roman empire the two centuries that followed are known as the pax romana a period of unprecedented peace prosperity and political stability in most of europe the empire continued to expand under emperors such as antoninus pius and marcus aurelius who spent time on the empires northern border fighting germanic pictish and scottish tribes christianity was legalised by constantine i in  ce after three centuries of imperial persecution constantine also permanently moved the capital of the empire from rome to the city of byzantium modernday istanbul which was renamed constantinople in his honour in  ce christianity became the sole official religion of the empire in  ce and in  ce the emperor theodosius outlawed pagan religions this is sometimes considered to mark the end of antiquity alternatively antiquity is considered to end with the fall of the western roman empire in  ce the closure of the pagan platonic academy of athens in  ce or the rise of islam in the early th century ce during most of its existence the byzantine empire was one of the most powerful economic cultural and military forces in europe early middle ages during the decline of the roman empire europe entered a long period of change arising from what historians call the age of migrations there were numerous invasions and migrations amongst the ostrogoths visigoths goths vandals huns franks angles saxons slavs avars bulgars vikings pechenegs cumans and magyars renaissance thinkers such as petrarch would later refer to this as the dark ages isolated monastic communities were the only places to safeguard and compile written knowledge accumulated previously apart from this very few written records survive much literature philosophy mathematics and other thinking from the classical period disappeared from western europe though they were preserved in the east in the byzantine empire while the roman empire in the west continued to decline roman traditions and the roman state remained strong in the predominantly greekspeaking eastern roman empire also known as the byzantine empire during most of its existence the byzantine empire was the most powerful economic cultural and military force in europe emperor justinian i presided over constantinoples first golden age he established a legal code that forms the basis of many modern legal systems funded the construction of the hagia sophia and brought the christian church under state control from the th century onwards as the byzantines and neighbouring sasanid persians were severely weakened due to the protracted centurieslasting and frequent byzantinesasanian wars the muslim arabs began to make inroads into historically roman territory taking the levant and north africa and making inroads into asia minor in the midth century following the muslim conquest of persia islam penetrated into the caucasus region over the next centuries muslim forces took cyprus malta crete sicily and parts of southern italy between  and  most of the lands of the visigothic kingdom of iberia were brought under muslim rulesave for small areas in the northwest asturias and largely basque regions in the pyrenees this territory under the arabic name alandalus became part of the expanding umayyad caliphate the unsuccessful second siege of constantinople  weakened the umayyad dynasty and reduced their prestige the umayyads were then defeated by the frankish leader charles martel at the battle of poitiers in  which ended their northward advance in the remote regions of northwestern iberia and the middle pyrenees the power of the muslims in the south was scarcely felt it was here that the foundations of the christian kingdoms of asturias leon and galicia were laid and from where the reconquest of the iberian peninsula would start however no coordinated attempt would be made to drive the moors out the christian kingdoms were mainly focused on their own internal power struggles as a result the reconquista took the greater part of eight hundred years in which period a long list of alfonsos sanchos ordonos ramiros fernandos and bermudos would be fighting their christian rivals as much as the muslim invaders during the dark ages the western roman empire fell under the control of various tribes the germanic and slav tribes established their domains over western and eastern europe respectively eventually the frankish tribes were united under clovis i charlemagne a frankish king of the carolingian dynasty who had conquered most of western europe was anointed holy roman emperor by the pope in  this led in  to the founding of the holy roman empire which eventually became centred in the german principalities of central europe east central europe saw the creation of the first slavic states and the adoption of christianity c  ce the powerful west slavic state of great moravia spread its territory all the way south to the balkans reaching its largest territorial extent under svatopluk i and causing a series of armed conflicts with east francia further south the first south slavic states emerged in the late th and th century and adopted christianity the first bulgarian empire the serbian principality later kingdom and empire and the duchy of croatia later kingdom of croatia to the east kievan rus expanded from its capital in kiev to become the largest state in europe by the th century in  vladimir the great adopted orthodox christianity as the religion of state further east volga bulgaria became an islamic state in the th century but was eventually absorbed into russia several centuries later high and late middle ages the period between the year  and  is known as the high middle ages followed by the late middle ages until c  during the high middle ages the population of europe experienced significant growth culminating in the renaissance of the th century economic growth together with the lack of safety on the mainland trading routes made possible the development of major commercial routes along the coast of the mediterranean and baltic seas the growing wealth and independence acquired by some coastal cities gave the maritime republics a leading role in the european scene the middle ages on the mainland were dominated by the two upper echelons of the social structure the nobility and the clergy feudalism developed in france in the early middle ages and soon spread throughout europe a struggle for influence between the nobility and the monarchy in england led to the writing of magna carta and the establishment of a parliament the primary source of culture in this period came from the roman catholic church through monasteries and cathedral schools the church was responsible for education in much of europe the papacy reached the height of its power during the high middle ages an eastwest schism in  split the former roman empire religiously with the eastern orthodox church in the byzantine empire and the roman catholic church in the former western roman empire in  pope urban ii called for a crusade against muslims occupying jerusalem and the holy land in europe itself the church organised the inquisition against heretics in the iberian peninsula the reconquista concluded with the fall of granada in  ending over seven centuries of islamic rule in the southwestern peninsula in the east a resurgent byzantine empire recaptured crete and cyprus from the muslims and reconquered the balkans constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in europe from the th to the th centuries with a population of approximately  the empire was weakened following the defeat at manzikert and was weakened considerably by the sack of constantinople in  during the fourth crusade although it would recover constantinople in  byzantium fell in  when constantinople was taken by the ottoman empire in the th and th centuries constant incursions by nomadic turkic tribes such as the pechenegs and the cumankipchaks caused a massive migration of slavic populations to the safer heavily forested regions of the north and temporarily halted the expansion of the rus state to the south and east like many other parts of eurasia these territories were overrun by the mongols the invaders who became known as tatars were mostly turkicspeaking peoples under mongol suzerainty they established the state of the golden horde with headquarters in crimea which later adopted islam as a religion and ruled over modernday southern and central russia for more than three centuries after the collapse of mongol dominions the first romanian states principalities emerged in the th century moldavia and walachia previously these territories were under the successive control of pechenegs and cumans from the th to the th centuries the grand duchy of moscow grew from a small principality under mongol rule to the largest state in europe overthrowing the mongols in  and eventually becoming the tsardom of russia the state was consolidated under ivan iii the great and ivan the terrible steadily expanding to the east and south over the next centuries the great famine of  was the first crisis that would strike europe in the late middle ages the period between  and  witnessed the heaviest loss the population of france was reduced by half medieval britain was afflicted by  famines and france suffered the effects of  or more in the same period europe was devastated in the midth century by the black death one of the most deadly pandemics in human history which killed an estimated  million people in europe alonea third of the european population at the time the plague had a devastating effect on europes social structure it induced people to live for the moment as illustrated by giovanni boccaccio in the decameron  it was a serious blow to the roman catholic church and led to increased persecution of jews beggars and lepers the plague is thought to have returned every generation with varying virulence and mortalities until the th century during this period more than  plague epidemics swept across europe early modern period the renaissance was a period of cultural change originating in florence and later spreading to the rest of europe the rise of a new humanism was accompanied by the recovery of forgotten classical greek and arabic knowledge from monastic libraries often translated from arabic into latin the renaissance spread across europe between the th and th centuries it saw the flowering of art philosophy music and the sciences under the joint patronage of royalty the nobility the catholic church and an emerging merchant class patrons in italy including the medici family of florentine bankers and the popes in rome funded prolific quattrocento and cinquecento artists such as raphael michelangelo and leonardo da vinci political intrigue within the church in the midth century caused the western schism during this year period two popesone in avignon and one in romeclaimed rulership over the church although the schism was eventually healed in  the papacys spiritual authority had suffered greatly in the th century europe started to extend itself beyond its geographic frontiers spain and portugal the greatest naval powers of the time took the lead in exploring the world exploration reached the southern hemisphere in the atlantic and the southern tip of africa christopher columbus reached the new world in  and vasco da gama opened the ocean route to the east linking the atlantic and indian oceans in  the portugueseborn explorer ferdinand magellan reached asia westward across the atlantic and the pacific oceans in a spanish expedition resulting in the first circumnavigation of the globe completed by the spaniard juan sebastian elcano  soon after the spanish and portuguese began establishing large global empires in the americas asia africa and oceania france the netherlands and england soon followed in building large colonial empires with vast holdings in africa the americas and asia in  the spanish armada failed to invade england a year later england tried unsuccessfully to invade spain allowing philip ii of spain to maintain his dominant war capacity in europe this english disaster also allowed the spanish fleet to retain its capability to wage war for the next decades however two more spanish armadas failed to invade england nd spanish armada and rd spanish armada the churchs power was further weakened by the reformation which began in  when german theologian martin luther nailed his ninetyfive theses criticising the selling of indulgences to the church door he was subsequently excommunicated in the papal bull exsurge domine in  and his followers were condemned in the  diet of worms which divided german princes between protestant and catholic faiths religious fighting and warfare spread with protestantism the plunder of the empires of the americas allowed spain to finance religious persecution in europe for over a century the thirty years war  crippled the holy roman empire and devastated much of germany killing between  and  percent of its population in the aftermath of the peace of westphalia france rose to predominance within europe the defeat of the ottoman turks at the battle of vienna in  marked the historic end of ottoman expansion into europe in much of central and eastern europe the th century was a period of general decline the region experienced more than  famines in a year period between  and  from the union of krewo  eastcentral europe was dominated by the kingdom of poland and the grand duchy of lithuania the hegemony of the vast polishlithuanian commonwealth had ended with the devastation brought by the northern war of  deluge and subsequent conflicts the state itself was partitioned and ceased to exist at the end of the th century from the th to th centuries when the disintegrating khanates of the golden horde were conquered by russia tatars from the crimean khanate frequently raided eastern slavic lands to capture slaves further east the nogai horde and kazakh khanate frequently raided the slavicspeaking areas of contemporary russia and ukraine for hundreds of years until the russian expansion and conquest of most of northern eurasia ie eastern europe central asia and siberia the renaissance and the new monarchs marked the start of an age of discovery a period of exploration invention and scientific development important figures of the scientific revolution during the th and th centuries included copernicus kepler galileo and isaac newton according to peter barrett it is widely accepted that modern science arose in the europe of the th century towards the end of the renaissance introducing a new understanding of the natural world th and th centuries the seven years war brought to an end the old system of alliances in europe consequently when the american revolutionary war turned into a global war between  and  britain found itself opposed by a strong coalition of european powers and lacking any substantial ally the age of enlightenment was a powerful intellectual movement during the th century promoting scientific and reasonbased thoughts discontent with the aristocracy and clergys monopoly on political power in france resulted in the french revolution and the establishment of the first republic as a result of which the monarchy and many of the nobility perished during the initial reign of terror napoleon bonaparte rose to power in the aftermath of the french revolution and established the first french empire that during the napoleonic wars grew to encompass large parts of europe before collapsing in  with the battle of waterloo napoleonic rule resulted in the further dissemination of the ideals of the french revolution including that of the nation state as well as the widespread adoption of the french models of administration law and education the congress of vienna convened after napoleons downfall established a new balance of power in europe centred on the five great powers the uk france prussia austria and russia this balance would remain in place until the revolutions of  during which liberal uprisings affected all of europe except for russia and the uk these revolutions were eventually put down by conservative elements and few reforms resulted the year  saw the unification of romania as a nation state from smaller principalities in  the austrohungarian empire was formed  saw the unifications of both italy and germany as nationstates from smaller principalities in parallel the eastern question grew more complex ever since the ottoman defeat in the russoturkish war  as the dissolution of the ottoman empire seemed imminent the great powers struggled to safeguard their strategic and commercial interests in the ottoman domains the russian empire stood to benefit from the decline whereas the habsburg empire and britain perceived the preservation of the ottoman empire to be in their best interests meanwhile the serbian revolution  and greek war of independence  marked the beginning of the end of ottoman rule in the balkans which ended with the balkan wars in  formal recognition of the de facto independent principalities of montenegro serbia and romania ensued at the congress of berlin in  the industrial revolution started in great britain in the last part of the th century and spread throughout europe the invention and implementation of new technologies resulted in rapid urban growth mass employment and the rise of a new working class reforms in social and economic spheres followed including the first laws on child labour the legalisation of trade unions and the abolition of slavery in britain the public health act of  was passed which significantly improved living conditions in many british cities europes population increased from about  million in  to  million by  the last major famine recorded in western europe the great famine of ireland caused death and mass emigration of millions of irish people in the th century  million people left europe in migrations to various european colonies abroad and to the united states the industrial revolution also led to large population growth and the share of the world population living in europe reached a peak of slightly above  around the year  th century to the present two world wars and an economic depression dominated the first half of the th century the first world war was fought between  and  it started when archduke franz ferdinand of austria was assassinated by the yugoslav nationalist gavrilo princip most european nations were drawn into the war which was fought between the entente powers france belgium serbia portugal russia the united kingdom and later italy greece romania and the united states and the central powers austriahungary germany bulgaria and the ottoman empire the war left more than  million civilians and military dead over  million european soldiers were mobilised from  to  russia was plunged into the russian revolution which threw down the tsarist monarchy and replaced it with the communist soviet union leading also to the independence of many former russian governorates such as finland estonia latvia and lithuania as new european countries austriahungary and the ottoman empire collapsed and broke up into separate nations and many other nations had their borders redrawn the treaty of versailles which officially ended the first world war in  was harsh towards germany upon whom it placed full responsibility for the war and imposed heavy sanctions excess deaths in russia over the course of the first world war and the russian civil war including the postwar famine amounted to a combined total of  million in  under stalins leadership confiscations of grain by the soviet authorities contributed to the second soviet famine which caused millions of deaths surviving kulaks were persecuted and many sent to gulags to do forced labour stalin was also responsible for the great purge of  in which the nkvd executed  people millions of people were deported and exiled to remote areas of the soviet union the social revolutions sweeping through russia also affected other european nations following the great war in  with the weimar republic in germany and the first austrian republic in  with mussolinis oneparty fascist government in the kingdom of italy and in ataturks turkish republic adopting the western alphabet and state secularism economic instability caused in part by debts incurred in the first world war and loans to germany played havoc in europe in the late s and s this and the wall street crash of  brought about the worldwide great depression helped by the economic crisis social instability and the threat of communism fascist movements developed throughout europe placing adolf hitler in power of what became nazi germany in  hitler became the leader of germany and began to work towards his goal of building greater germany germany reexpanded and took back the saarland and rhineland in  and  in  austria became a part of germany following the anschluss following the munich agreement signed by germany france the united kingdom and italy later in  germany annexed the sudetenland which was a part of czechoslovakia inhabited by ethnic germans in early  the remainder of czechoslovakia was split into the protectorate of bohemia and moravia controlled by germany and the slovak republic at the time the united kingdom and france preferred a policy of appeasement with tensions mounting between germany and poland over the future of danzig the germans turned to the soviets and signed the molotovribbentrop pact which allowed the soviets to invade the baltic states and parts of poland and romania germany invaded poland on  september  prompting france and the united kingdom to declare war on germany on  september opening the european theatre of the second world war the soviet invasion of poland started on  september and poland fell soon thereafter on  september the soviet union attacked the baltic countries and on  november finland the latter of which was followed by the devastating winter war for the red army the british hoped to land at narvik and send troops to aid finland but their primary objective in the landing was to encircle germany and cut the germans off from scandinavian resources around the same time germany moved troops into denmark the phoney war continued in may  germany attacked france through the low countries france capitulated in june  by august germany had begun a bombing offensive against the united kingdom but failed to convince the britons to give up in  germany invaded the soviet union in operation barbarossa on  december  japans attack on pearl harbor drew the united states into the conflict as allies of the british empire and other allied forces after the staggering battle of stalingrad in  the german offensive in the soviet union turned into a continual fallback the battle of kursk which involved the largest tank battle in history was the last major german offensive on the eastern front in june  british and american forces invaded france in the dday landings opening a new front against germany berlin finally fell in  ending the second world war in europe the war was the largest and most destructive in human history with  million dead across the world more than  million people in europe had died as a result of the second world war including between  and  million people who perished during the holocaust the soviet union lost around  million people mostly civilians during the war about half of all second world war casualties by the end of the second world war europe had more than  million refugees several postwar expulsions in central and eastern europe displaced a total of about  million people the first world war and especially the second world war diminished the eminence of western europe in world affairs after the second world war the map of europe was redrawn at the yalta conference and divided into two blocs the western countries and the communist eastern bloc separated by what was later called by winston churchill an iron curtain the united states and western europe established the nato alliance and later the soviet union and central europe established the warsaw pact particular hot spots after the second world war were berlin and trieste whereby the free territory of trieste founded in  with the un was dissolved in  and  respectively the berlin blockade in  and  and the construction of the berlin wall in  were one of the great international crises of the cold war the two new superpowers the united states and the soviet union became locked in a fiftyyearlong cold war centred on nuclear proliferation at the same time decolonisation which had already started after the first world war gradually resulted in the independence of most of the european colonies in asia and africa in the s the reforms of mikhail gorbachev and the solidarity movement in poland weakened the previously rigid communist system the opening of the iron curtain at the paneuropean picnic then set in motion a peaceful chain reaction at the end of which the eastern bloc the warsaw pact and other communist states collapsed and the cold war ended germany was reunited after the symbolic fall of the berlin wall in  and the maps of central and eastern europe were redrawn once more this made old previously interrupted cultural and economic relationships possible and previously isolated cities such as berlin prague vienna budapest and trieste were now again in the centre of europe european integration also grew after the second world war in  the council of europe was founded following a speech by sir winston churchill with the idea of unifying europe to achieve common goals it includes all european states except for belarus russia and vatican city the treaty of rome in  established the european economic community between six western european states with the goal of a unified economic policy and common market in  the eec european coal and steel community and euratom formed the european community which in  became the european union the eu established a parliament a court and a central bank and introduced the euro as a unified currency between  and  more central european countries began joining expanding the eu to  european countries and once more making europe a major economical and political centre of power however the united kingdom withdrew from the eu on  january  as a result of a june  referendum on eu membership the russoukrainian war steeply escalated after the  russian invasion of ukraine on  february  marking the largest humanitarian and refugee crisis in europe since the second world war and the yugoslav wars geography europe makes up the western fifth of the eurasian landmass it has a higher ratio of coast to landmass than any other continent or subcontinent its maritime borders consist of the arctic ocean to the north the atlantic ocean to the west and the mediterranean black and caspian seas to the south land relief in europe shows great variation within relatively small areas the southern regions are more mountainous while moving north the terrain descends from the high alps pyrenees and carpathians through hilly uplands into broad low northern plains which are vast in the east this extended lowland is known as the great european plain and at its heart lies the north german plain an arc of uplands also exists along the northwestern seaboard which begins in the western parts of the islands of britain and ireland and then continues along the mountainous fjordcut spine of norway this description is simplified subregions such as the iberian peninsula and the italian peninsula contain their own complex features as does mainland central europe itself where the relief contains many plateaus river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend subregions like iceland britain and ireland are special cases the former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean that is counted as part of europe while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising sea levels cut them off the largest european lakes are located in the north of the continent the volga and danube are the two longest rivers of europe europes largest waterfall by flow rate are the rhine falls on the rhine climate europe lies mainly in the temperate climate zone of the northern hemisphere where the prevailing wind direction is from the west the climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the gulf stream an ocean current which carries warm water from the gulf of mexico across the atlantic ocean to europe the gulf stream is nicknamed europes central heating because it makes europes climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be the gulf stream not only carries warm water to europes coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the atlantic ocean therefore the average temperature throughout the year of aveiro is  c  f while it is only  c  f in new york city which is almost on the same latitude bordering the same ocean berlin germany calgary canada and irkutsk in far southeastern russia lie on around the same latitude january temperatures in berlin average around  c  f higher than those in calgary and they are almost  c  f higher than average temperatures in irkutsk the large water masses of the mediterranean sea which equalise the temperatures on an annual and daily average are also of particular importance the water of the mediterranean extends from the sahara desert to the alpine arc in its northernmost part of the adriatic sea near trieste in general europe is not just colder towards the north compared to the south but it also gets colder from the west towards the east the climate is more oceanic in the west and less so in the east this can be illustrated by the following table of average temperatures at locations roughly following the th th th th th and th latitudes none of them is located at high altitude most of them are close to the sea the average temperatures for the coldest month as well as the annual average temperatures drop from the west to the east for instance edinburgh is warmer than belgrade during the coldest month of the year although belgrade is around  of latitude farther south climate change geology the geological history of europe traces back to the formation of the baltic shield fennoscandia and the sarmatian craton both around  billion years ago followed by the volgouralia shield the three together leading to the east european craton  baltica which became a part of the supercontinent columbia around  billion years ago baltica and arctica as part of the laurentia block became joined to rodinia later resplitting around  million years ago to reform as baltica around  million years ago euramerica was formed from baltica and laurentia a further joining with gondwana then leading to the formation of pangea around  million years ago gondwana and laurasia split apart due to the widening of the atlantic ocean finally and very soon afterwards laurasia itself split up again into laurentia north america and the eurasian continent the land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time via greenland leading to interchange of animal species from around  million years ago rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of europe and its connections with continents such as asia europes present shape dates to the late tertiary period about five million years ago the geology of europe is hugely varied and complex and gives rise to the wide variety of landscapes found across the continent from the scottish highlands to the rolling plains of hungary europes most significant feature is the dichotomy between highland and mountainous southern europe and a vast partially underwater northern plain ranging from ireland in the west to the ural mountains in the east these two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the pyrenees and alpscarpathians the northern plains are delimited in the west by the scandinavian mountains and the mountainous parts of the british isles major shallow water bodies submerging parts of the northern plains are the celtic sea the north sea the baltic sea complex and barents sea the northern plain contains the old geological continent of baltica and so may be regarded geologically as the main continent while peripheral highlands and mountainous regions in the south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents most of the older geology of western europe existed as part of the ancient microcontinent avalonia flora having lived side by side with agricultural peoples for millennia europes animals and plants have been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of humans with the exception of fennoscandia and northern russia few areas of untouched wilderness are currently found in europe except for various national parks the main natural vegetation cover in europe is mixed forest the conditions for growth are very favourable in the north the gulf stream and north atlantic drift warm the continent southern europe has a warm but mild climate there are frequent summer droughts in this region mountain ridges also affect the conditions some of these such as the alps and the pyrenees are oriented eastwest and allow the wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior others are oriented southnorth scandinavian mountains dinarides carpathians apennines and because the rain falls primarily on the side of mountains that is oriented towards the sea forests grow well on this side while on the other side the conditions are much less favourable few corners of mainland europe have not been grazed by livestock at some point in time and the cutting down of the preagricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant and animal ecosystems possibly  to  percent of europe was once covered by forest it stretched from the mediterranean sea to the arctic ocean although over half of europes original forests disappeared through the centuries of deforestation europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest such as the broadleaf and mixed forests taiga of scandinavia and russia mixed rainforests of the caucasus and the cork oak forests in the western mediterranean during recent times deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted however in many cases monoculture plantations of conifers have replaced the original mixed natural forest because these grow quicker the plantations now cover vast areas of land but offer poorer habitats for many european forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure the amount of natural forest in western europe is just  or less while in its western russia its  the european country with the smallest percentage of forested area is iceland  while the most forested country is finland  in temperate europe mixed forest with both broadleaf and coniferous trees dominate the most important species in central and western europe are beech and oak in the north the taiga is a mixed sprucepinebirch forest further north within russia and extreme northern scandinavia the taiga gives way to tundra as the arctic is approached in the mediterranean many olive trees have been planted which are very well adapted to its arid climate mediterranean cypress is also widely planted in southern europe the semiarid mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest a narrow eastwest tongue of eurasian grassland the steppe extends westwards from ukraine and southern russia and ends in hungary and traverses into taiga to the north fauna glaciation during the most recent ice age and the presence of humans affected the distribution of european fauna as for the animals in many parts of europe most large animals and top predator species have been hunted to extinction the woolly mammoth was extinct before the end of the neolithic period today wolves carnivores and bears omnivores are endangered once they were found in most parts of europe however deforestation and hunting caused these animals to withdraw further and further by the middle ages the bears habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with sufficient forest cover today the brown bear lives primarily in the balkan peninsula scandinavia and russia a small number also persist in other countries across europe austria pyrenees etc but in these areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised because of the destruction of their habitat in addition polar bears may be found on svalbard a norwegian archipelago far north of scandinavia the wolf the secondlargest predator in europe after the brown bear can be found primarily in central and eastern europe and in the balkans with a handful of packs in pockets of western europe scandinavia spain etc other carnivores include the european wildcat red fox and arctic fox the golden jackal different species of martens the european hedgehog different species of reptiles like snakes such as vipers and grass snakes and amphibians as well as different birds owls hawks and other birds of prey important european herbivores are snails larvae fish different birds and mammals like rodents deer and roe deer boars and living in the mountains marmots steinbocks chamois among others a number of insects such as the small tortoiseshell butterfly add to the biodiversity sea creatures are also an important part of european flora and fauna the sea flora is mainly phytoplankton important animals that live in european seas are zooplankton molluscs echinoderms different crustaceans squids and octopuses fish dolphins and whales biodiversity is protected in europe through the council of europes bern convention which has also been signed by the european community as well as noneuropean states politics the political map of europe is substantially derived from the reorganisation of europe following the napoleonic wars in  the prevalent form of government in europe is parliamentary democracy in most cases in the form of republic in  the prevalent form of government was still the monarchy europes remaining eleven monarchies are constitutional european integration is the process of political legal economic and in some cases social and cultural integration of european states as it has been pursued by the powers sponsoring the council of europe since the end of the second world war the european union has been the focus of economic integration on the continent since its foundation in  more recently the eurasian economic union has been established as a counterpart comprising former soviet states  european states are members of the politicoeconomic european union  of the borderfree schengen area and  of the monetary union eurozone among the smaller european organisations are the nordic council the benelux the baltic assembly and the visegrad group the least democratic countries in europe are belarus russia and turkey in  according to the vdem democracy indices list of states and territories this list includes all internationally recognised sovereign countries falling even partially under any common geographical or political definitions of europe within the abovementioned states are several de facto independent countries with limited to no international recognition none of them are members of the un several dependencies and similar territories with broad autonomy are also found within or close to europe this includes aland an autonomous county of finland two autonomous territories of the kingdom of denmark other than denmark proper three crown dependencies and two british overseas territories svalbard is also included due to its unique status within norway although it is not autonomous not included are the three countries of the united kingdom with devolved powers and the two autonomous regions of portugal which despite having a unique degree of autonomy are not largely selfgoverning in matters other than international affairs areas with little more than a unique tax status such as the canary islands and heligoland are also not included for this reason economy as a continent the economy of europe is currently the largest on earth and it is the richest region as measured by assets under management with over  trillion compared to north americas  trillion in  in  europe remained the wealthiest region its  trillion in assets under management represented onethird of the worlds wealth it was one of several regions where wealth surpassed its precrisis yearend peak as with other continents europe has a large wealth gap among its countries the richer states tend to be in the northwest and west in general followed by central europe while most economies of eastern and southeastern europe are still reemerging from the collapse of the soviet union and the breakup of yugoslavia the model of the blue banana was designed as an economic geographic representation of the respective economic power of the regions which was further developed into the golden banana or blue star the trade between east and west as well as towards asia which had been disrupted for a long time by the two world wars new borders and the cold war increased sharply after  in addition there is new impetus from the chinese belt and road initiative across the suez canal towards africa and asia the european union a political entity composed of  european states comprises the largest single economic area in the world nineteen eu countries share the euro as a common currency four european countries rank in the top ten of the worlds largest national economies in gdp ppp this includes ranks according to the imf russia  germany  france  and the united kingdom  some european countries are much richer than others the richest in terms of nominal gdp is monaco with its us per capita  and the poorest is ukraine with its us per capita  as a whole europes gdp per capita is us according to a  international monetary fund assessment economic history industrial growth  capitalism has been dominant in the western world since the end of feudalism from britain it gradually spread throughout europe the industrial revolution started in europe specifically the united kingdom in the late th century and the th century saw western europe industrialise economies were disrupted by the first world war but by the beginning of the second world war they had recovered and were having to compete with the growing economic strength of the united states the second world war again damaged much of europes industries cold war  after the second world war the economy of the uk was in a state of ruin and continued to suffer relative economic decline in the following decades italy was also in a poor economic condition but regained a high level of growth by the s west germany recovered quickly and had doubled production from prewar levels by the s france also staged a remarkable comeback enjoying rapid growth and modernisation later on spain under the leadership of franco also recovered and the nation recorded huge unprecedented economic growth beginning in the s in what is called the spanish miracle the majority of central and eastern european states came under the control of the soviet union and thus were members of the council for mutual economic assistance comecon the states which retained a freemarket system were given a large amount of aid by the united states under the marshall plan the western states moved to link their economies together providing the basis for the eu and increasing cross border trade this helped them to enjoy rapidly improving economies while those states in comecon were struggling in a large part due to the cost of the cold war until  the european community was expanded from  founding members to  the emphasis placed on resurrecting the west german economy led to it overtaking the uk as europes largest economy reunification present with the fall of communism in central and eastern europe in  the postsocialist states underwent shock therapy measures to liberalise their economies and implement free market reforms after east and west germany were reunited in  the economy of west germany struggled as it had to support and largely rebuild the infrastructure of east germany while the latter experienced sudden mass unemployment and plummeting of industrial production by the millennium change the eu dominated the economy of europe comprising the five largest european economies of the time germany the united kingdom france italy and spain in   of the  members of the eu joined the eurozone replacing their national currencies by the euro figures released by eurostat in  confirmed that the eurozone had gone into recession in  it affected much of the region the euro area crisis especially affected greece ireland spain and portugal as a result measures were taken especially for greece by the leading countries of the eurozone the european union unemployment rate was  in  for those aged  it was  demographics the population of europe was about  million in  according to un estimates this is slightly more than one ninth of the worlds population the population density of europe the number of people per area is the second highest of any continent behind asia the population of europe is currently slowly decreasing by about  per year because there are fewer births than deaths this natural decrease in population is reduced by the fact that more people migrate to europe from other continents than vice versa southern europe and western europe are the regions with the highest average number of elderly people in the world in  the percentage of people over  years old was  in western europe and southern europe compared to  in all of europe and  in the world projections suggest that by  europe will reach  this is caused by the fact that the population has been having children below replacement level since the s the united nations predicts that europe will decline in population between  and  by  per cent without changing immigration movements according to a population projection of the un population division europes population may fall to between  and  million people by  which would be  of the world population at that time within this context significant disparities exist between regions in relation to fertility rates the average number of children per female of childbearing age is  far below the replacement rate the un predicts a steady population decline in central and eastern europe as a result of emigration and low birth rates ethnic groups pan and pfeil  count  distinct peoples of europe of which  form the majority population in at least one sovereign state while the remaining  constitute ethnic minorities romani people are the largest ethnic minority in europe according to european commission migration europe is home to the highest number of migrants of all global regions at nearly  million people in  according to the international organisation for migration in  the eu had an overall net gain from immigration of  million people this accounted for almost  of europes total population growth in   persons were given citizenship of an eu member state an increase of about  compared with   million immigrants from noneu countries entered the eu in  early modern emigration from europe began with spanish and portuguese settlers in the th century and french and english settlers in the th century but numbers remained relatively small until waves of mass emigration in the th century when millions of poor families left europe today large populations of european descent are found on every continent european ancestry predominates in north america and to a lesser degree in south america particularly in uruguay argentina chile and brazil while most of the other latin american countries also have a considerable population of european origins australia and new zealand have large europeanderived populations africa has no countries with europeanderived majorities or with the exception of cape verde and probably sao tome and principe depending on context but there are significant minorities such as the white south africans in south africa in asia europeanderived populations specifically russians predominate in north asia and some parts of northern kazakhstan also in asia europeans especially the spanish are an influential minority population in the philippines languages europe has about  indigenous languages mostly falling within three indoeuropean language groups the romance languages derived from the latin of the roman empire the germanic languages whose ancestor language came from southern scandinavia and the slavic languages slavic languages are mostly spoken in southern central and eastern europe romance languages are spoken primarily in western and southern europe as well as in switzerland in central europe and romania and moldova in eastern europe germanic languages are spoken in western northern and central europe as well as in gibraltar and malta in southern europe languages in adjacent areas show significant overlaps such as in english for example other indoeuropean languages outside the three main groups include the baltic group latvian and lithuanian the celtic group irish scottish gaelic manx welsh cornish and breton greek armenian and albanian a distinct nonindoeuropean family of uralic languages estonian finnish hungarian erzya komi mari moksha and udmurt is spoken mainly in estonia finland hungary and parts of russia turkic languages include azerbaijani kazakh and turkish in addition to smaller languages in eastern and southeast europe balkan gagauz turkish bashkir chuvash crimean tatar karachaybalkar kumyk nogai and tatar kartvelian languages georgian mingrelian and svan are spoken primarily in georgia two other language families reside in the north caucasus termed northeast caucasian most notably including chechen avar and lezgin and northwest caucasian most notably including adyghe maltese is the only semitic language that is official within the eu while basque is the only european language isolate multilingualism and the protection of regional and minority languages are recognised political goals in europe today the council of europe framework convention for the protection of national minorities and the council of europes european charter for regional or minority languages set up a legal framework for language rights in europe romani is spoken throughout europe by the roma minority religion the largest religion in europe is christianity with  of europeans considering themselves christians including catholic eastern orthodox and various protestant denominations among protestants the most popular are lutheranism anglicanism and the reformed faith smaller protestant denominations include anabaptists as well as denominations centred in the united states such as pentecostalism methodism and evangelicalism although christianity originated in the middle east its centre of mass shifted to europe when it became the official religion of the roman empire in the late th century christianity played a prominent role in the development of the european culture and identity today just over  of the worlds christians live in europe islam is the second most popular religion in europe over  million or roughly  of the population adhere to it in albania and bosnia and herzegovina two countries in the balkan peninsula in southeastern europe islam instead of christianity is the majority religion this is also the case in turkey and in certain parts of russia as well as in azerbaijan and kazakhstan all of which are at the border to asia many countries in europe are home to a sizeable muslim minority and immigration to europe has increased the number of muslim people in europe in recent years the jewish population in europe was about  million people in  about  of the population there is a long history of jewish life in europe beginning in antiquity during the late th and early th centuries the russian empire had the majority of the worlds jews living within its borders in  according to russian census of  the total jewish population of russia was  million people which was  of total population of this total the vast majority lived within the pale of settlement in  there were about  million jewish people in europe representing  of the population but most were killed and most of the rest displaced during the holocaust in the st century france has the largest jewish population in europe followed by the united kingdom germany and russia other religions practiced in europe include hinduism and buddhism which are minority religions except in russias republic of kalmykia where tibetan buddhism is the majority religion a large and increasing number of people in europe are irreligious atheist and agnostic they are estimated to make up about  of europes population currently major cities and urban areas the three largest urban areas of europe are moscow london and paris all have over  million residents and as such have been described as megacities while istanbul has the highest total city population it lies partly in asia  of the residents live on the european side and  on the asian side the next largest cities in order of population are madrid saint petersburg milan barcelona berlin and rome each having over three million residents when considering the commuter belts or metropolitan areas within europe for which comparable data is available moscow covers the largest population followed in order by istanbul london paris madrid milan ruhr area saint petersburg rheinsud barcelona and berlin culture europe as a cultural concept is substantially derived from the shared heritage of ancient greece and the roman empire and its cultures the boundaries of europe were historically understood as those of christendom or more specifically latin christendom as established or defended throughout the medieval and early modern history of europe especially against islam as in the reconquista and the ottoman wars in europe this shared cultural heritage is combined by overlapping indigenous national cultures and folklores roughly divided into slavic latin romance and germanic but with several components not part of either of these groups notably greek basque and celtic historically special examples with overlapping cultures are strasbourg with latin romance and germanic or trieste with latin slavic and germanic roots cultural contacts and mixtures shape a large part of the regional cultures of europe europe is often described as maximum cultural diversity with minimal geographical distances different cultural events are organised in europe with the aim of bringing different cultures closer together and raising awareness of their importance such as the european capital of culture the european region of gastronomy the european youth capital and the european capital of sport sport sport in europe tends to be highly organised with many sports having professional leagues the origins of many of the worlds most popular sports today lie in the codification of many traditional games especially in the united kingdom however a paradoxical feature of european sport is the extent to which local regional and national variations continue to exist and even in some instances to predominate social dimension in europe many people are unable to access basic social conditions which makes it harder for them to thrive and flourish access to basic necessities can be compromised for example  of europeans spend at least  of household income on housing  million europeans feel socially isolated from the s income inequality has been rising and wage shares have been falling in  the richest  of households earned over five times more than the poorest  many workers experience stagnant real wages and precarious work is common even for essential workers see also notes references
