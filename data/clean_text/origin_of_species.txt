when on board h m s  beagle as a naturalist i was much struck with certain facts in the distribution of the organic beings inhabiting south america and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent these facts as will be seen in the latter chapters of this volume seemed to throw some light on the origin of speciesthat mystery of mysteries as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers on my return home it occurred to me in  that something might perhaps be made out on this question by patiently accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could possibly have any bearing on it after five years work i allowed myself to speculate on the subject and drew up some short notes  these i enlarged in  into a sketch of the conclusions which then seemed to me probable  from that period to the present day i have steadily pursued the same object i hope that i may be excused from entering on these personal details as i give them to show that i have not been hasty in coming to a decision my work is now nearly finished  but as it will take me two or three more years to complete it and as my health is far from strong i have been urged to publish this abstract i have more especially been induced to do this as mr wallace who is now studying the natural history of the malay archipelago has arrived at almost exactly the same general conclusions that i have on the origin of species in  he sent me a memoir on this subject with a request that i would forward it to sir charles lyell who sent it to the linnean society and it is published in the third volume of the journal of that society sir c lyell and dr hooker who both knew of my workthe latter having read my sketch of honored mo by thinking it advisable to publish with mr wallaces excel lent memoir some brief extracts from my manuscripts this abstract which i now publish must necessarily be imperfect i cannot here give references and authorities for my several statements  and i must trust to the reader reposing some confidence in my accuracy no doubt errors will have crept in though i hope i have always been cautious in trusting to good authorities alone i can here give only the general conclusions at which i have arrived with a few facts in illustration but which i hope in most cases will suffice no one can feel more sensible than i do of the necessity of hereafter publishing in detail all the facts with references on which my conclusions have been grounded and i hope in a future work to do this for i am well aware that scarcely a single point is discussed in this volume on which facts cannot be adduced often apparently leading to conclusions directly opposite to those at which i have arrived a fair result can be obtained only by fully stating and balancing the facts and arguments on both sides of each question and this is here impossible i much regret that want of space prevents my having the satisfaction of acknowledging the generous assistance which i have received from very many naturalists some of them personally unknown to me i cannot however let this opportunity pass without expressing my deep obligations to dr hooker who for the last fifteen years has aided me in every possible way by his large stores of knowledge and his excellent judgment in considering the origin of species it is quite conceivable that a naturalist reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings on their embryological relations their geographical distribution geological succession and other such facts might come to the conclusion that species had not been independently created but had descended like varieties from other species nevertheless such a conclusion even if well founded would be unsatisfactory until it could be shown how the innumerable species inhabiting this world have been modified so as to ac quire that perfection of structure and coadaptation which justly excites our admiration naturalists continually refer to external conditions such as climate food etc as the only possible cause of variation in one limited sense as we shall hereafter see this may be true  but it is preposterous to attribute to mere external conditions the structure for instance of the woodpecker with its feet tail beak and tongue so admirably adapted to catch insects under the bark of trees in the case of the mistletoe which draws its nourishment from certain trees which has seeds that must be transported by certain birds and which has flowers with separate sexes absolutely requiring the agency of certain insects to bring pollen from one flower to the other it is equally preposterous to account for the structure of this parasite with its relations to several dis tinct organic beings by the effects of external conditions or of habit or of the volition of the plant itself it is therefore of the highest importance to gain a clear insight into the means of modification and adaptation at the commencement of my observations it seemed to me prob able that a careful study of domesticated animals and of cultivated plants would offer the best chance of making out this obscure problem nor have i been disappointed in this and in all other perplexing cases i have invariably found that our knowledge imperfect though it be of variation under domestication afforded the best and safest clew i may venture to express my conviction of the high value of such studies although they have been very commonly neglected by naturalists from these considerations i shall devote the first chapter of this abstract to variation under domestication we shall thus see that a large amount of hereditary modification is at least possible  and what is equally or more important we shall see how great is the power of man in accumulating by his selection successive slight variations i will then pass on to the variability of species in a state of nature  but i shall unfortunately be compelled to treat this subject far too briefly as it can be treated properly only by giving long catalogues of facts we shall however be enabled to discuss what circumstances are most favorable to variation in the next chapter the struggle for existence among all organic beings throughout the world which inevitably follows from the high geometrical ratio of their increase will be treated of this is the doctrine of malthus applied to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms as many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive  and as consequently there is a frequentlyrecurring struggle for existence it follows that any being if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life will have a better chance of surviving and thus be naturally selected from the strong principle of inheritance any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form this fundamental subject of natural selection will be treated at some length in the fourth chapter  and we shall then see how natural selection almost inevitably causes much extinction of the less improved forms of life and leads to what i have called divergence of character in the next chapter i shall discuss the complex and littleknown laws of variation in the four succeeding chapters the most apparent and gravest difficulties in accepting the theory will be given  namely first the difficulties of transitions or how a simple being or a simple organ can be changed and perfected into a highlydeveloped being or into an elaboratelyconstructed organ secondly the subject of instinct or the mental powers of animals  thirdly hybridism or the infertility of species and the fertility of varieties when intercrossed  and fourthly the imperfection of the geological record in the next chapter i shall consider the geological succession of organic beings throughout time  in the eleventh and twelfth their geographical distribution throughout space  in the thirteenth their classification or mutual affinities both when mature and in an embryonic condition in the last chapter i shall give a brief recapitulation of the whole work and a few concluding remarks no one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained in regard to the origin of species and varieties if he makes due allowance for our profound ignorance in regard to the mutual relations of the many beings which live around us who can explain why one species ranges widely and is very numerous and why another allied species has a narrow range and is rare  yet these relations are of the highest importance for they determine the present welfare and as i believe the future success and modification of every inhabitant of this world still less do we know of the mutual relations of the innumerable inhabitants of the world during the many past geological epochs in its history although much remains obscure and will long remain obscure i can entertain no doubt after the most deliberate study and dispassionate judgment of which i am capable that the view which most naturalists entertain and which i formerly entertainednamely that each species has been independently createdis erroneous i am fully convinced that species are not immutable  but that those belonging to what are called the same genera are lineal descendants of some other and generally extinct species in the same manner as the acknowledged varieties of any one species are the descendants of that species further more i am convinced that natural selection has been the most important but not the exclusive means of modification
