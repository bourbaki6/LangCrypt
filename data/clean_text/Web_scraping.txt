web scraping web harvesting or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites web scraping software may directly access the world wide web using the hypertext transfer protocol or a web browser while web scraping can be done manually by a software user the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler it is a form of copying in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web typically into a central local database or spreadsheet for later retrieval or analysis scraping a web page involves fetching it and then extracting data from it fetching is the downloading of a page which a browser does when a user views a page therefore web crawling is a main component of web scraping to fetch pages for later processing having fetched extraction can take place the content of a page may be parsed searched and reformatted and its data copied into a spreadsheet or loaded into a database web scrapers typically take something out of a page to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else an example would be finding and copying names and telephone numbers companies and their urls or email addresses to a list contact scraping another example is collecting competitors product prices for marketing purposes contact scraping is a type of web scraping that is used as a component of applications used for web indexing web mining and data mining online price change monitoring and price comparison product review scraping to watch the competition gathering real estate listings weather data monitoring website change detection research tracking online presence and reputation web mashup and web data integration web pages are built using textbased markup languages html and xhtml and frequently contain a wealth of useful data in text form however most web pages are designed for human endusers and not for ease of automated use as a result specialized tools and software have been developed to facilitate the scraping of web pages web scraping applications include market research price comparison content monitoring and artificial intelligence businesses rely on web scraping services to efficiently gather and utilize this data newer forms of web scraping involve monitoring data feeds from web servers for example json is commonly used as a transport mechanism between the client and the web server there are methods that some websites use to prevent web scraping such as detecting and disallowing bots from crawling viewing their pages in response web scraping systems use techniques involving dom parsing computer vision and natural language processing to simulate humanlike browsing to enable gathering web page content for offline parsing history after the birth of the world wide web in  the first web robot world wide web wanderer was created in june  which was intended only to measure the size of the web in december  the first crawlerbased web search engine jumpstation was launched as there were fewer websites available on the web search engines at that time used to rely on human administrators to collect and format links in comparison jump station was the first www search engine to rely on a web robot in  the first web api and api crawler were created in  salesforce and ebay launched their own api with which programmers could access and download some of the data available to the public since then many websites offer web apis for people to access their public database techniques data extraction techniques range from manual collection to sophisticated automated systems advanced methods analyze the underlying structure of web pages to transform unstructured content into a machinereadable format these techniques utilize text processing or artificial intelligence aligning with the technical goals of the semantic web human copyandpaste the simplest form of web scraping is manually copying and pasting data from a web page into a text file or spreadsheet sometimes even the best webscraping technology cannot replace a humans manual examination and copyandpaste and sometimes this may be the only workable solution when the websites for scraping explicitly set up barriers to prevent machine automation text pattern matching a simple yet capable approach to extract information from web pages is to use the unix grep command or regular expressionmatching facilities of programming languages for instance perl or python in order to find text matching a specified pattern http programming static and dynamic web pages can be retrieved by posting http requests to the remote web server using socket programming html parsing many websites have large collections of pages generated dynamically from an underlying structured source like a database data of the same category are typically encoded into similar pages by a common script or template in data mining a program that detects such templates in a particular information source extracts its content and translates it into a relational form is called a wrapper wrapper generation algorithms assume that input pages of a wrapper induction system conform to a common template and that they can be easily identified in terms of a url common scheme moreover some semistructured data query languages such as xquery and the htql can be used to parse html pages and to retrieve and transform page content dom parsing by using a program such as selenium or playwright developers can control a web browser such as chrome or firefox wherein they can load navigate and retrieve data from websites this method can be especially useful for scraping data from dynamic sites since a web browser will fully load each page once an entire page is loaded you can access and parse the dom using an expression language such as xpath vertical aggregation there are several companies that have developed vertical specific harvesting platforms these platforms create and monitor a multitude of bots for specific verticals with no man in the loop no direct human involvement and no work related to a specific target site the preparation involves establishing the knowledge base for the entire vertical and then the platform creates the bots automatically the platforms robustness is measured by the quality of the information it retrieves usually number of fields and its scalability how quick it can scale up to hundreds or thousands of sites this scalability is mostly used to target the long tail of sites that common aggregators find complicated or too laborintensive to harvest content from semantic annotation recognizing the pages being scraped may embrace metadata or semantic markups and annotations which can be used to locate specific data snippets if the annotations are embedded in the pages as microformat does this technique can be viewed as a special case of dom parsing in another case the annotations organized into a semantic layer are stored and managed separately from the web pages so the scrapers can retrieve data schema and instructions from this layer before scraping the pages computer vision webpage analysis there are efforts using machine learning and computer vision that attempt to identify and extract information from web pages by interpreting pages visually as a human being might legal issues the legality of web scraping varies across the world in general web scraping may be against the terms of service of some websites but the enforceability of these terms is unclear united states in the united states website owners can use three major legal claims to prevent undesired web scraping  copyright infringement compilation  violation of the computer fraud and abuse act cfaa and  trespass to chattel however the effectiveness of these claims relies upon meeting various criteria and the case law is still evolving for example with regard to copyright while outright duplication of original expression will in many cases be illegal in the united states the courts ruled in feist publications v rural telephone service that duplication of facts is allowable us courts have acknowledged that users of scrapers or robots may be held liable for committing trespass to chattels which involves a computer system itself being considered personal property upon which the user of a scraper is trespassing the best known of these cases ebay v bidders edge resulted in an injunction ordering bidders edge to stop accessing collecting and indexing auctions from the ebay web site this case involved automatic placing of bids known as auction sniping however in order to succeed on a claim of trespass to chattels the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant intentionally and without authorization interfered with the plaintiffs possessory interest in the computer system and that the defendants unauthorized use caused damage to the plaintiff not all cases of web spidering brought before the courts have been considered trespass to chattels one of the first major tests of screen scraping involved american airlines aa and a firm called farechase aa successfully obtained an injunction from a texas trial court stopping farechase from selling software that enables users to compare online fares if the software also searches aas website the airline argued that farechases websearch software trespassed on aas servers when it collected the publicly available data farechase filed an appeal in march  by june farechase and aa agreed to settle and the appeal was dropped southwest airlines has also challenged screenscraping practices and has involved both farechase and another firm outtask in a legal claim southwest airlines charged that the screenscraping is illegal since it is an example of computer fraud and abuse and has led to damage and loss and unauthorized access of southwests site it also constitutes interference with business relations trespass and harmful access by computer they also claimed that screenscraping constitutes what is legally known as misappropriation and unjust enrichment as well as being a breach of the web sites user agreement outtask denied all these claims claiming that the prevailing law in this case should be us copyright law and that under copyright the pieces of information being scraped would not be subject to copyright protection although the cases were never resolved in the supreme court of the united states farechase was eventually shuttered by parent company yahoo and outtask was purchased by travel expense company concur in  a startup called taps scraped classified housing ads from craigslist craigslist sent taps a ceaseanddesist letter and blocked their ip addresses and later sued in craigslist v taps the court held that the ceaseanddesist letter and ip blocking was sufficient for craigslist to properly claim that taps had violated the computer fraud and abuse act cfaa although these are early scraping decisions and the theories of liability are not uniform it is difficult to ignore a pattern emerging that the courts are prepared to protect proprietary content on commercial sites from uses which are undesirable to the owners of such sites however the degree of protection for such content is not settled and will depend on the type of access made by the scraper the amount of information accessed and copied the degree to which the access adversely affects the site owners system and the types and manner of prohibitions on such conduct while the law in this area becomes more settled entities contemplating using scraping programs to access a public web site should also consider whether such action is authorized by reviewing the terms of use and other terms or notices posted on or made available through the site in cvent inc v eventbrite inc  the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia ruled that the terms of use should be brought to the users attention in order for a browsewrap contract or license to be enforceable in a  case filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania ecommerce site qvc objected to the pinterestlike shopping aggregator resultlys scraping of qvcs site for realtime pricing data qvc alleges that resultly excessively crawled qvcs retail site allegedly sending  search requests to qvcs website per minute sometimes to up to  requests per minute which caused qvcs site to crash for two days resulting in lost sales for qvc qvcs complaint alleges that the defendant disguised its web crawler to mask its source ip address and thus prevented qvc from quickly repairing the problem this is a particularly interesting scraping case because qvc is seeking damages for the unavailability of their website which qvc claims was caused by resultly in the plaintiffs web site during the period of this trial the terms of use link are displayed among all the links of the site at the bottom of the page as most sites on the internet this ruling contradicts the irish ruling described below the court also rejected the plaintiffs argument that the browsewrap restrictions were enforceable in view of virginias adoption of the uniform computer information transactions act ucitaa uniform law that many believed was in favor on common browsewrap contracting practices in facebook inc v power ventures inc a district court ruled in  that power ventures could not scrape facebook pages on behalf of a facebook user the case is on appeal and the electronic frontier foundation filed a brief in  asking that it be overturned in associated press v meltwater us holdings inc a court in the us held meltwater liable for scraping and republishing news information from the associated press but a court in the united kingdom held in favor of meltwater the ninth circuit ruled in  that web scraping did not violate the cfaa in hiq labs v linkedin the case was appealed to the united states supreme court which returned the case to the ninth circuit to reconsider the case in light of the  supreme court decision in van buren v united states which narrowed the applicability of the cfaa on this review the ninth circuit upheld their prior decision internet archive collects and distributes a significant number of publicly available web pages without being considered to be in violation of copyright laws european union in february  the danish maritime and commercial court copenhagen ruled that systematic crawling indexing and deep linking by portal site ofirdk of real estate site homedk does not conflict with danish law or the database directive of the european union ethical data scraping supports offmarket sourcing in business but must comply with gdpr to avoid privacy violations in automated data collection in a february  case complicated by matters of jurisdiction irelands high court delivered a verdict that illustrates the inchoate state of developing case law in the case of ryanair ltd v billigfluegede gmbh irelands high court ruled ryanairs clickwrap agreement to be legally binding in contrast to the findings of the united states district court eastern district of virginia and those of the danish maritime and commercial court justice michael hanna ruled that the hyperlink to ryanairs terms and conditions was plainly visible and that placing the onus on the user to agree to terms and conditions in order to gain access to online services is sufficient to comprise a contractual relationship the decision is under appeal in irelands supreme court on april   the french data protection authority cnil released new guidelines on web scraping the cnil guidelines made it clear that publicly available data is still personal data and cannot be repurposed without the knowledge of the person to whom that data belongs australia in australia the spam act  outlaws some forms of web harvesting although this only applies to email addresses india leaving a few cases dealing with ipr infringement indian courts have not expressly ruled on the legality of web scraping however since all common forms of electronic contracts are enforceable in india violating the terms of use prohibiting data scraping will be a violation of the contract law it will also violate the information technology act  which penalizes unauthorized access to a computer resource or extracting data from a computer resource methods to prevent web scraping the administrator of a website can use various measures to stop or slow a bot some techniques include blocking an ip address either manually or based on criteria such as geolocation and dnsrbl this will also block all browsing from that address disabling any web service api that the websites system might expose bots sometimes declare who they are using user agent strings and can be blocked on that basis using robotstxt googlebot is an example other bots make no distinction between themselves and a human using a browser bots can be blocked by monitoring excess traffic bots can sometimes be blocked with tools to verify that it is a real person accessing the site like a captcha bots are sometimes coded to explicitly break specific captcha patterns or may employ thirdparty services that utilize human labor to read and respond in realtime to captcha challenges they can be triggered because the bot is  making too many requests in a short time  using lowquality proxies or  not covering the web scrapers fingerprint properly commercial antibot services companies offer antibot and antiscraping services for websites a few web application firewalls have limited bot detection capabilities as well however many such solutions are not very effective locating bots with a honeypot or other method to identify the ip addresses of automated crawlers obfuscation using css sprites to display such data as telephone numbers or email addresses at the cost of accessibility to screen reader users because bots rely on consistency in the frontend code of a target website adding small variations to the htmlcss surrounding important data and navigation elements would require more human involvement in the initial set up of a bot and if done effectively may render the target website too difficult to scrape due to the diminished ability to automate the scraping process websites can declare if crawling is allowed or not in the robotstxt file and allow partial access limit the crawl rate specify the optimal time to crawl and more trapping bots in a tarpit feeding them nonsensical data to poison their dataset this method is particularly effective against bots which ignore robotstxt files tls fingerprinting modern security systems analyze the transport layer security tls handshake to identify the client application different clients eg google chrome vs a python script send cryptographic ciphers and extensions in unique orders this creates a unique fingerprint such as a ja signature that allows servers to detect and block automated scripts
