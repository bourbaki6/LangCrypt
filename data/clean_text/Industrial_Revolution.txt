the industrial revolution sometimes divided into the first industrial revolution and second industrial revolution was a transitional period of the global economy toward more widespread efficient and stable manufacturing processes succeeding the second agricultural revolution beginning in great britain around  the industrial revolution had spread to continental europe and the united states by about  this transition included going from hand production methods to machines new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes the increasing use of water power and steam power the development of machine tools and rise of the mechanised factory system output greatly increased and the result was an unprecedented rise in population and population growth the textile industry was the first to use modern production methods and textiles became the dominant industry in terms of employment value of output and capital invested  many technological and architectural innovations were british by the midth century britain was the leading commercial nation controlled a global trading empire with colonies in north america and the caribbean and had military and political hegemony on the indian subcontinent the development of trade and rise of business were among the major causes of the industrial revolution developments in law facilitated the revolution such as courts ruling in favour of property rights an entrepreneurial spirit and consumer revolution helped drive industrialisation the industrial revolution influenced almost every aspect of life in particular average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth economists note the most important effect was that the standard of living for most in the western world began to increase consistently for the first time though others have said it did not begin to improve meaningfully until the th century gdp per capita was broadly stable before the industrial revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy afterwards saw an era of percapita economic growth in capitalist economies economic historians agree that the onset of the industrial revolution is the most important event in human history comparable only to the adoption of agriculture with respect to material advancement the precise start and end of the industrial revolution is debated among historians as is the pace of economic and social changes according to leigh shawtaylor britain was already industrialising in the th century eric hobsbawm held that the industrial revolution began in britain in the s and was not fully felt until the s while t s ashton held that it occurred between  and  rapid adoption of mechanized textiles spinning occurred in britain in the s and high rates of growth in steam power and iron production occurred after  mechanised textile production spread from britain to continental europe and the us in the early th century a recession occurred from the late s when the adoption of the industrial revolutions early innovations such as mechanised spinning and weaving slowed as markets matured despite increased adoption of locomotives steamships and hot blast iron smelting new technologies such as the electrical telegraph widely introduced in the s in the uk and us were not sufficient to drive high rates of growth rapid growth reoccurred after  springing from new innovations in the second industrial revolution these included steelmaking processes mass production assembly lines electrical grid systems largescale manufacture of machine tools and use of advanced machinery in steampowered factories etymology the earliest recorded use of industrial revolution was in  by french envoy louisguillaume otto announcing that france had entered the race to industrialise raymond williams states the idea of a new social order based on major industrial change was clear in southey and owen between  and was implicit as early as blake in the early s and wordsworth at the turn of the th century the term industrial revolution applied to technological change became more common by the s as in jeromeadolphe blanquis description in  of la revolution industrielle friedrich engels in the condition of the working class in england in  spoke of an industrial revolution a revolution whichchanged the whole of civil society his book was not translated into english until the late th century and the expression did not enter everyday language till then credit for its popularisation is given to arnold toynbee whose  lectures gave a detailed account of the term economic historians such as mendels pomeranz and kridte argue protoindustrialisation in parts of europe the islamic world mughal india and china created the social and economic conditions that led to the industrial revolution thus causing the great divergence some historians such as john clapham and nicholas crafts have argued that the economic and social changes occurred gradually and that revolution is a misnomer requirements several key factors enabled industrialisation high agricultural productivityexemplified by the british agricultural revolutionfreed up labor and ensured food surpluses the presence of skilled managers and entrepreneurs an extensive network of ports rivers canals and roads for efficient transport and abundant natural resources such as coal iron and water power further supported industrial growth political stability a legal system favorable to business and access to financial capital also played crucial roles once industrialisation began in britain in the th century its spread was facilitated by the eagerness of british entrepreneurs to export industrial methods and the willingness of other nations to adopt them by the early th century industrialisation had reached western europe and the united states and by the late th century japan important technological developments the commencement of the industrial revolution is closely linked to a small number of innovations beginning in the second half of the th century by the s the following gains had been made in important technologies textiles  mechanised cotton spinning powered by water and later steam increased output per worker by a factor of around  the power loom increased output by a factor of  the cotton gin increased productivity of removing seed from cotton by a factor of  large gains in productivity occurred in spinning and weaving of wool and linen but were not as great as in cotton steam power  the efficiency of steam engines increased so they used between onefifth and onetenth as much fuel the adaptation of stationary steam engines to rotary motion made them suitable for industrial uses the highpressure engine had a high powertoweight ratio making it suitable for transportation steam power underwent a rapid expansion after  ironmaking  the substitution of coke for charcoal greatly lowered the fuel cost of pig iron and wrought iron production using coke also allowed larger blast furnaces resulting in economies of scale the steam engine began being used to power blast air in the s enabling a large increase in iron production by overcoming the limitation of water power the cast iron blowing cylinder was first used in  it was improved by making it double acting which allowed higher blast furnace temperatures the puddling process produced structural grade iron at lower cost than the finery forge the rolling mill was fifteen times faster than hammering wrought iron developed in  hot blast greatly increased fuel efficiency in iron production invention of machine tools  the first machine tools were the screwcutting lathe the cylinder boring machine and the milling machine machine tools made the economical manufacture of precision metal parts possible although it took decades to develop effective techniques for making interchangeable parts textile manufacture british textile industry in  britain imported  million pounds of raw cotton most of which was spun and woven by the cottage industry in lancashire the work was done by hand in workers homes or master weavers shops wages were six times those in india in  when productivity in britain was three times higher in  raw cotton consumption was  million pounds most of which was cleaned carded and spun on machines the british textile industry used  million pounds of cotton in  and  million pounds in  the share of value added by the cotton industry in britain was  in   in  and  in  value added by the woollen industry was  in  cotton factories numbered about  in  in  approximately onethird of cotton cloth manufactured was exported rising to twothirds by  in  cotton spun amounted to  million pounds which increased to  million pounds by  in  less than  of world cotton cloth was produced on machinery invented in britain in  there were  spindles in britain rising to  million over the next  years wool the earliest european attempts at mechanised spinning were with wool however wool spinning proved more difficult to mechanise than cotton productivity improvement in wool spinning during the industrial revolution was significant but less than cotton silk arguably the first highly mechanised factory was john lombes waterpowered silk mill at derby operational by  lombe learned silk thread manufacturing by taking a job in italy and acting as an industrial spy however because the italian silk industry guarded its secrets the state of the industry at that time is unknown although lombes factory was technically successful the supply of raw silk from italy was cut off to eliminate competition to promote manufacturing the crown paid for models of lombes machinery which were exhibited in the tower of london cotton parts of india china central america south america and the middle east have a history of handmanufacturing cotton textiles which became a major industry after  ad most cotton was grown by small farmers alongside food and spun in households for domestic consumption in the s china began to require households to pay part of their taxes in cotton cloth by the th century almost all chinese wore cotton clothing and it could be used as a medium of exchange in india cotton textiles were manufactured for distant markets often produced by professional weavers cotton was a difficult raw material for europe to obtain before it was grown on colonial plantations spanish explorers found native americans growing sea island gossypium barbadense and upland cotton gossypium hirsutum sea island cotton was exported from barbados from the s upland cotton was uneconomical because of the difficulty of removing seed a problem solved by the cotton gin a strain of cotton seed brought from mexico to natchez mississippi in  became the parent genetic material for  of world production today it produced bolls three to four times faster to pick trade and textiles the age of discovery was followed by colonialism beginning around the th century following the discovery of a trade route to india around southern africa by the portuguese the british founded the east india company and other countries founded companies which established trading posts throughout the indian ocean region a large segment of this trade was in cotton textiles which were purchased in india and sold in southeast asia including the indonesian archipelago where spices were purchased for sale to southeast asia and europe by the s cloth was over threequarters of the east india companys exports indian textiles were in demand in europe where previously only wool and linen were available however cotton goods consumed in europe was minor until the early th century premechanized european textile production by  flemish refugees began weaving cotton in english towns where cottage spinning and weaving of wool and linen was established they were left alone by the guilds who did not consider cotton a threat earlier european attempts at cotton spinning and weaving were in thcentury italy and thcentury southern germany but these ended when the supply of cotton was cut off british cloth could not compete with indian cloth because indias labour cost was approximately onefifth that of britains in  and  the british government passed calico acts to protect domestic woollen and linen industries from cotton fabric imported from india the demand for heavier fabric was met by a domestic industry based around lancashire that produced fustian a cloth with flax warp and cotton weft flax was used for the warp because wheelspun cotton had insufficient strength the resulting blend was not as soft as  cotton and more difficult to sew on the eve of the industrial revolution spinning and weaving were done in households for domestic consumption and as a cottage industry under the puttingout system under the puttingout system homebased workers produced under contract to merchant sellers who often supplied the raw materials in the offseason the women typically farmers wives did the spinning and the men did the weaving using the spinning wheel it took  spinners to supply one handloom weaver invention of textile machinery the flying shuttle patented in  by john kay doubled the output of a weaver worsening the imbalance between spinning and weaving it became widely used around lancashire after  when johns son robert invented the dropbox which facilitated changing thread colors lewis paul patented the roller spinning frame and the flyerandbobbin system for drawing wool to a more even thickness the technology was developed with john wyatt of birmingham in  a factory opened in northampton with  spindles on each of five of paul and wyatts machines a similar mill was built by daniel bourn paul and bourn patented carding machines in  based on two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds it was later used in the first cotton spinning mill in  in oswaldtwistle lancashire james hargreaves invented the spinning jenny it was the first practical spinning frame with multiple spindles the jenny worked similarly to the spinning wheel by first clamping down on the fibres then drawing them out followed by twisting it was a simple woodenframed machine that only cost  for a spindle model in  and was used mainly by home spinners the water frame was developed by richard arkwright who patented it in  the design was partly based on a spinning machine built by kay hired by arkwright the water frame could produce a hard mediumcount thread suitable for warp finally allowing  cotton cloth to be made in britain arkwright used water power at a factory in cromford derbyshire in  giving the invention its name samuel crompton invented the spinning mule in  so called because it is a hybrid of arkwrights water frame and james hargreavess spinning jenny cromptons mule could produce finer thread than hand spinning at lower cost mulespun thread was of suitable strength to be used as a warp and allowed britain to produce highly competitive yarn in large quantities realising expiration of the arkwright patent would greatly increase the supply of spun cotton and lead to a shortage of weavers edmund cartwright developed a vertical power loom which he patented in  samuel horrocks patented a loom in  which was improved by richard roberts in  and these were produced in large numbers by roberts hill  co roberts was a maker of highquality machine tools and pioneer in the use of jigs and gauges for precision workshop measurement the demand for cotton presented an opportunity to planters in the us who thought upland cotton would be profitable if a better way could be found to remove the seed eli whitney responded by inventing the inexpensive cotton gin a man using a cotton gin could remove seed in one day which previously took two months these advances were capitalised on by entrepreneurs of whom the best known is arkwright he is credited with a list of inventions but these were developed by such people as kay and thomas highs arkwright nurtured the inventors patented the ideas financed the initiatives and protected the machines he created the cotton mill which brought the production processes together in a factory and developed the use of power which made cotton manufacture a mechanised industry other inventors increased the efficiency of spinning so the supply of yarn increased greatly steam power was then applied to drive textile machinery manchester acquired the nickname cottonopolis during the early th century owing to its sprawl of textile factories though mechanisation dramatically decreased the cost of cotton cloth by the midth century machinewoven cloth still could not equal the quality of handwoven indian cloth however the high productivity of british textile manufacturing allowed coarser grades of british cloth to undersell handspun and woven fabric in lowwage india destroying the indian industry iron industry british iron production in the uk in  there were  tons of charcoal iron and  tons with coke in  charcoal iron production had dropped to  tons and coke cast iron was  tons in  the uk imported  tons of bar iron and either refined from cast iron or directly produced  tons of bar iron using charcoal and  tons using coke in  the uk was making  tons of bar iron with coke and  tons with charcoal imports were  tons and exports were  tons in  the uk did not import bar iron but exported  tons iron process innovations a major change in the iron industries during the industrial revolution was the replacement of wood and other biofuels with coal for a given amount of heat mining coal required much less labour than cutting wood and converting it to charcoal and coal was more abundant than wood supplies of which were becoming scarce before the enormous increase in iron production that took place in the late th century in  abraham darby made progress using coke to fuel his blast furnaces at coalbrookdale however the coke pig iron made was not suitable for making wrought iron and was used mostly for the production of cast iron goods he had the advantage over his rivals in that his pots cast by his patented process were thinner and cheaper in  coke had replaced charcoal in the smelting of copper and lead and was in widespread use in glass production in the smelting and refining of iron coal and coke produced inferior iron to that made with charcoal because of the coals sulfur content low sulfur coals were known but they still contained harmful amounts another factor limiting the iron industry was the scarcity of water power to power blast bellows this limitation was overcome by the steam engine use of coal in iron smelting started before the industrial revolution based on innovations by clement clerke and others from  using coal reverberatory furnaces known as cupolas these were operated by the flames playing on the ore and charcoal or coke mixture reducing the oxide to metal this has the advantage that impurities in the coal do not migrate into the metal this technology was applied to lead in  copper in  and iron foundries in the s but in this case the reverberatory furnace was known as an air furnace coke pig iron was hardly used to produce wrought iron until  when darbys son abraham darby ii built furnaces at horsehay and ketley where low sulfur coal was available and not far from coalbrookdale these furnaces were equipped with waterpowered bellows the water being pumped by newcomen atmospheric engines abraham darby iii installed similar steampumped waterpowered blowing cylinders at the dale company when he took control in  the dale company used newcomen engines to drain its mines and made parts for engines which it sold throughout the country steam engines made the use of higherpressure and volume blast practical however the leather used in bellows was expensive to replace in  ironmaster john wilkinson patented a hydraulic powered blowing engine for blast furnaces the blowing cylinder for blast furnaces was introduced in  and the first blowing cylinder made of cast iron is believed to be the one used at carrington in  designed by john smeaton cast iron cylinders for use with a piston were difficult to manufacture james watt had difficulty trying to have a cylinder made for his first steam engine in  wilkinson invented a machine for boring cylinders after wilkinson bored the first successful cylinder for a boulton and watt steam engine in  he was given an exclusive contract for providing cylinders watt developed a rotary steam engine in  they were widely applied to blowing hammering rolling and slitting in addition to lower cost and greater availability coke had other advantages over charcoal in that it was harder and made the column of materials flowing down the blast furnace more porous and did not crush in the much taller furnaces of the late th century as cast iron became cheaper and widely available it began being a structural material for bridges and buildings a famous early example is the iron bridge built in  with cast iron produced by abraham darby iii however most cast iron was converted to wrought iron conversion of cast iron had long been done in a finery forge an improved refining process known as potting and stamping was developed but this was superseded by henry corts puddling process cort developed significant iron manufacturing processes rolling in  and puddling in  puddling produced a structural grade iron at a relatively low cost puddling was backbreaking and extremely hot work few puddlers lived to be  puddling became widely used after  british iron manufacturers had used considerable amounts of iron imported from sweden and russia to supplement domestic supplies because of the increased british production by the s britain eliminated imports and became a net exporter of bar iron hot blast patented by the scottish inventor james beaumont neilson in  was the most important development of the th century for saving energy in making pig iron the amount of fuel to make a unit of pig iron was reduced at first by between onethird using coke or twothirds using coal the efficiency gains continued as the technology improved hot blast raised the operating temperature of furnaces increasing their capacity using less coal or coke meant introducing fewer impurities into the pig iron this meant that lower quality coal could be used in areas where coking coal was unavailable or too expensive however by the end of the th century transportation costs fell considerably shortly before the industrial revolution an improvement was made in the production of steel which was an expensive commodity and used only where iron would not do such as for cutting edge tools and springs benjamin huntsman developed his crucible steel technique in the s the supply of cheaper iron and steel aided a number of industries such as those making nails hinges wire and other hardware items the development of machine tools allowed better working of iron causing it to be increasingly used in the rapidly growing machinery and engine industries steam power the development of the stationary steam engine was important in the industrial revolution however during its early period most industrial power was supplied by water and wind in britain by  an estimated  horsepower was being supplied by steam by  steam power had grown to  hp the first commercially successful industrial use of steam power was patented by thomas savery in  he constructed in london a lowlift combined vacuum and pressure water pump that generated about one horsepower hp and was used in waterworks and a few mines the first successful piston steam engine was introduced by thomas newcomen before  newcomen engines were installed for draining hitherto unworkable deep mines with the engine on the surface these were large machines requiring a significant amount of capital and produced upwards of  kw  hp they were extremely inefficient by modern standards but when located where coal was cheap at pit heads they opened up a great expansion in coal mining by allowing mines to go deeper the engines spread to hungary in  then germany and sweden  were built by  in the s john smeaton built large examples and introduced improvements  engines had been built by  despite their disadvantages newcomen engines were reliable and easy to maintain and continued to be used in coalfields until the early th century a fundamental change in working principles was brought about by james watt a scotsman with financial support from his business partner the englishman matthew boulton he had succeeded by  in perfecting his steam engine which incorporated radical improvements notably closing the upper part of the cylinder making the lowpressure steam drive the top of the piston instead of the atmosphere and the celebrated separate steam condenser chamber the separate condenser did away with the cooling water that had been injected directly into the cylinder which cooled the cylinder and wasted steam these improvements increased engine efficiency so boulton and watts engines used only  as much coal per horsepowerhour as newcomens boulton and watt opened the soho foundry for the manufacture of such engines in  in  the watt steam engine had been fully developed into a doubleacting rotative type which meant it could be used to directly drive the rotary machinery of a factory or mill both of watts basic engine types were commercially successful and by  the firm boulton and watt had constructed  engines with  driving reciprocating pumps  serving blast furnaces and  powering mill machinery most of the engines generated from  to  kw  to  hp until about  the most common pattern of steam engine was the beam engine built as an integral part of a stone or brick enginehouse but soon selfcontained rotative engines were developed such as the table engine around the start of the th century at which time the boulton and watt patent expired the cornish engineer richard trevithick and the american oliver evans began to construct higherpressure noncondensing steam engines exhausting against the atmosphere watt himself had refrained from building any such engine for fear of its dangers holding back the development of selfpropelled machines high pressure yielded an engine and boiler compact enough to be used on mobile road and rail locomotives and steamboats small industrial power requirements continued to be provided by animal and human muscle until widespread electrification in the th century these included crankpowered treadlepowered and horsepowered machinery in workshops and small plants machine tools over time it was shown that wooden components had the disadvantage of changing dimensions with temperature and humidity and the joints tended to work loose as the industrial revolution progressed machines with metal parts and frames making them more common other uses of metal parts were in firearms and threaded fasteners such as machine screws bolts and nuts there was need for precision in making parts to allow better working machinery interchangeability of parts and standardization of threaded fasteners the demand for metal parts led to the development of several machine tools they have their origins in the tools developed in the th century by clock and scientific instrument makers to enable them to batchproduce small mechanisms before machine tools metal was worked manually using the basic hand tools hammers files scrapers saws and chisels consequently use of metal machine parts was kept to a minimum hand methods of production were laborious and costly and precision was difficult to achieve the first large precision machine tool was the cylinder boring machine invented by john wilkinson in  it was designed to bore the large cylinders on steam engines wilkinsons machine was the first to use the principle of lineboring where the tool is supported on both ends the planing machine the milling machine and the shaping machine were developed though the milling machine was invented at this time it was not developed as a serious workshop tool until later james fox and matthew murray were manufacturers of machine tools who found success in exports and developed the planer around the same time as richard roberts henry maudslay who trained a school of machine tool makers was a mechanic who had been employed at the royal arsenal woolwich he worked as an apprentice under jan verbruggen who in  installed a horizontal boring machine which was the first industrial size lathe in the uk maudslay was hired by joseph bramah for the production of highsecurity metal locks that required precision craftsmanship bramah patented a lathe with similarities to the slide rest lathe maudslay perfected this lathe which cut machine screws of different thread pitches before its invention screws could not be cut with precision the slide rest lathe was called one of historys most important inventions although it was not maudslays idea he was the first to build a functional lathe using innovations of the lead screw slide rest and change gears maudslay set up a shop and built the machinery for making ships pulley blocks for the royal navy in the portsmouth block mills these machines were allmetal and the first for mass production and making components with interchangeability the lessons maudslay learned about the need for stability and precision he adapted to the development of machine tools and he trained men to build on his work such as richard roberts joseph clement and joseph whitworth the techniques to make massproduced metal parts of sufficient precision to be interchangeable is attributed to the us department of war which perfected interchangeable parts for firearms in the halfcentury following the invention of the fundamental machine tools the machine industry became the largest industrial sector of the us economy chemicals largescale production of chemicals was an important development the first of these was the production of sulphuric acid by the lead chamber process invented by john roebuck in  he was able to increase the scale of the manufacture by replacing expensive glass vessels with larger cheaper chambers made of riveted sheets of lead instead of a small amount he was able to make around  kilograms  pounds in each chamber a tenfold increase the production of an alkali on a large scale became an important goal and nicolas leblanc succeeded in  in introducing a method for the production of sodium carbonate soda ash the leblanc process was a reaction of sulfuric acid with sodium chloride to give sodium sulfate and hydrochloric acid the sodium sulfate was heated with calcium carbonate and coal to give a mixture of sodium carbonate and calcium sulfide adding water separated the soluble sodium carbonate from the calcium sulfide the process produced significant pollution nonetheless this synthetic soda ash proved economical compared to that from burning plants and to potash potassium carbonate produced from hardwood ashes soda ash and sulphuric acid were important because they enabled the introduction of other inventions replacing smallscale operations with more costeffective and controllable processes sodium carbonate had uses in the glass textile soap and paper industries early uses for sulfuric acid included pickling removing rust from iron and steel and for bleaching cloth the development of bleaching powder calcium hypochlorite by chemist charles tennant in  based on the discoveries of claude louis berthollet revolutionised the bleaching processes in the textile industry by reducing the time required for the traditional process then in use repeated exposure to the sun in fields after soaking the textiles with alkali or sour milk tennants st rollox chemical works glasgow became the worlds largest chemical plant after  the focus on chemical innovation was in dyestuffs and germany took leadership building a strong chemical industry aspiring chemists flocked to german universities in  to learn the latest techniques british scientists lacked research universities and did not train advanced students instead the practice was to hire germantrained chemists concrete in  joseph aspdin a british bricklayer turned builder patented a chemical process for making portland cement an important advance in the building trades this process involves sintering clay and limestone to about  c  f then grinding it into a fine powder which is mixed with water sand and gravel to produce concrete in the s josephs son william aspdin developed his fathers invention portland cement concrete was used by english engineer marc isambard brunel when constructing the thames tunnel the worlds first underwater tunnel portland cement concrete was used on a large scale in the construction of the london sewer system a generation later gas lighting though others made a similar innovation the largescale introduction of gas lighting was the work of william murdoch an employee of boulton  watt the process consisted of the largescale gasification of coal in furnaces purification of the gas and its storage and distribution the first gas lighting utilities were established in london between  and  they became one of the major consumers of coal in the uk gas lighting affected social and industrial organisation because it allowed factories and stores to remain open longer its introduction allowed nightlife to flourish in cities and towns as interiors and streets could be lighted on a larger scale than before glass making glass was made in ancient greece and rome a new method of glass production known as the cylinder process was developed in europe during the th century in  this process was used by the chance brothers to create sheet glass they became the leading producers of window and plate glass this advancement allowed for larger panes of glass to be created without interruption thus freeing up the space planning in interiors as well as the fenestration of buildings the crystal palace is a significant example of the use of sheet glass in a new and innovative structure paper machine a machine for making a continuous sheet of paper on a loop of wire fabric was patented in  by louisnicolas robert in france the paper machine is known as a fourdrinier after the financiers brothers sealy and henry fourdrinier who were stationers in london the fourdrinier machine is the predominant means of production today the method of continuous production demonstrated by the paper machine influenced the development of continuous rolling of iron steel and other continuous production processes agriculture the british agricultural revolution raised crop yields and released labour for industrial employment although percapita food supply in much of europe remained stagnant until the late th century key innovations included jethro tulls early thcentury mechanical seed drill  which ensured more even sowing and depth control joseph foljambes iron rotherham plough c  and andrew meikles threshing machine  which reduced manual labour requirements hand threshing with a flail was a laborious job that had taken about onequarter of agricultural labour lower labour requirements resulted in lower wages and fewer labourers who faced near starvation leading to the  swing riots mining coal mining in britain started early before the steam engine pits were often shallow bell pits following a seam of coal along the surface which were abandoned as the coal was extracted if the geology was favourable the coal was mined by means of an adit or drift mine driven into the side of a hill shaft mining was done in some areas but the limiting factor was the problem of removing water it could be done by hauling buckets up the shaft or to a sough a tunnel driven into a hill to drain a mine the water had to be discharged into a stream or ditch at a level where it could flow away introduction of the steam pump by thomas savery in  and the newcomen steam engine in  facilitated removal of water and enabled deeper shafts enabling more coal to be extracted these developments had begun before the industrial revolution but the adoption of smeatons improvements to the newcomen engine followed by watts steam engines from the s reduced the fuel costs making mines more profitable the cornish engine developed in the s was more efficient than the watt engine coal mining was dangerous owing to the presence of firedamp in coal seams a degree of safety was provided by the safety lamp invented in  by sir humphry davy and independently by george stephenson however the lamps proved a false dawn because they became unsafe quickly and provided weak light firedamp explosions continued often setting off coal dust explosions so casualties grew during the th century conditions were very poor with a high casualty rate from rock falls transportation at the beginning of the industrial revolution inland transport was by navigable rivers and roads with coastal vessels employed to move heavy goods wagonways were used for conveying coal to rivers for further shipment but canals had not yet been widely constructed animals supplied all motive power on land with sails providing motive power on the sea the first horse railways were introduced toward the end of the th century with steam locomotives introduced in the early th century improving sailing technologies boosted speed by  between  and  the industrial revolution improved britains transport infrastructure with turnpike road waterway and rail networks raw materials and finished products could be moved quicker and cheaper than before improved transport allowed ideas to spread quickly canals and improved waterways before and during the industrial revolution navigation on british rivers was improved by removing obstructions straightening curves widening and deepening and building navigation locks britain had over  kilometres  mi of navigable rivers and streams by  canals and waterways allowed bulk materials to be economically transported long distances inland this was because a horse could pull a barge with a tens of times larger than could be drawn in a cart canals began to be built in the uk in the late th century to link major manufacturing centres known for its huge commercial success the bridgewater canal in north west england was opened in  and mostly funded by the rd duke of bridgewater from worsley to the rapidly growing town of manchester its construction cost   as of  but its advantages over land and river transport meant that within one year the coal price in manchester fell by half this success inspired canal mania canals were hastily built with the aim of replicating the commercial success of bridgewater the most notable being the leeds and liverpool canal and the thames and severn canal which opened in  and  respectively by the s a national network was in existence canal construction served as a model for the organisation and methods used to construct the railways they were largely superseded by the railways from the s the last major canal built in the uk was the manchester ship canal which upon opening in  was the worlds largest ship canal and opened manchester as a port however it never achieved the commercial success its sponsors hoped for and signalled canals as a dying transport mode in an age dominated by railways which were quicker and often cheaper britains canal network and its mill buildings is one of the most enduring features of the industrial revolution to be seen in britain roads france was known for having an excellent road system at this time however most roads on the european continent and in the uk were in bad condition dangerously rutted much of the original british road system was poorly maintained by local parishes but from the s turnpike trusts were set up to charge tolls and maintain some roads increasing numbers of main roads were turnpiked from the s almost every main road in england and wales was the responsibility of a turnpike trust new engineered roads were built by john metcalf thomas telford and john mcadam with the first macadam stretch of road being marsh road at ashton gate bristol in  the first macadam road in the us was the boonsborough turnpike road between hagerstown and boonsboro maryland in  the major turnpikes radiated from london and were the means by which the royal mail was able to reach the rest of the country heavy goods transport on these roads was by slow broadwheeled carts hauled by teams of horses lighter goods were conveyed by smaller carts or teams of packhorse stagecoaches carried the rich and the less wealthy rode on carriers carts productivity of road transport increased greatly during the industrial revolution and the cost of travel fell dramatically between  and  productivity tripled for longdistance carrying and increased fourfold in stage coaching railways railways were made practical by the widespread introduction of inexpensive puddled iron after  the rolling mill for making rails and the development of the highpressure steam engine reduced friction was a major reason for the success of railways compared to wagons this was demonstrated on an iron platecovered wooden tramway in  at croydon england a good horse on an ordinary turnpike road can draw two thousand pounds or one ton a party of gentlemen were invited to witness the experiment that the superiority of the new road might be established by ocular demonstration twelve wagons were loaded with stones till each wagon weighed three tons and the wagons were fastened together a horse was then attached which drew the wagons with ease six miles  km in two hours having stopped four times in order to show he had the power of starting as well as drawing his great load wagonways for moving coal in the mining areas had started in the th century and were often associated with canal or river systems for the further movement these were horsedrawn or relied on gravity with a stationary steam engine to haul the wagons back to the top of the incline the first applications of steam locomotive were on wagon or plate ways horsedrawn public railways begin in the early th century when improvements to pig and wrought iron production lowered costs steam locomotives began being built after the introduction of highpressure steam engines after the expiration of the boulton and watt patent in  highpressure engines exhausted used steam to the atmosphere doing away with the condenser and cooling water they were much lighter and smaller in size for a given horsepower than the stationary condensing engines a few of these early locomotives were used in mines steamhauled public railways began with the stockton and darlington railway in  the rapid introduction of railways followed the  rainhill trials which demonstrated robert stephensons successful locomotive design and the  development of hot blast which dramatically reduced the fuel consumption of making iron and increased the capacity of the blast furnace on  september  the liverpool and manchester railway the first intercity railway in the world was opened the railway was engineered by joseph locke and george stephenson linked the rapidly expanding industrial town of manchester with the port of liverpool the railway became highly successful transporting passengers and freight the success of the intercity railway particularly in the transport of freight and commodities led to railway mania construction of major railways connecting the larger cities and towns began in the s but only gained momentum at the very end of the first industrial revolution after many of the workers had completed the railways they did not return to the countryside but remained in the cities providing additional workers for the factories social effects the industrial revolution effectively asked the social question demanding new ideas for managing large groups visible poverty growing population and materialistic wealth caused tensions between the richest and poorest these tensions were sometimes violently released and led to philosophical ideas such as socialism communism and anarchism factory system prior to the industrial revolution most were employed in agriculture as selfemployed farmers tenants landless agricultural labourers it was common for families to spin yarn weave cloth and make their clothing households also spun and wove for market production at the beginning of the industrial revolution india china and regions of iraq and elsewhere in asia and the middle east produced most of the worlds cotton cloth while europeans produced wool and linen goods in great britain in the th century the puttingout system was practised by which farmers and townspeople produced goods for a market in their homes often described as cottage industry merchant capitalists typically provided the raw materials paid workers by the piece and were responsible for sales embezzlement of supplies by workers and poor quality were common the logistical effort in procuring and distributing raw materials and picking up finished goods were also limitations some early spinning and weaving machinery such as a  spindle jenny for about six pounds in  was affordable for cottagers later machinery such as spinning frames spinning mules and power looms were expensive giving rise to capitalist ownership of factories most textile factory workers during the industrial revolution were unmarried women and children including many orphans they worked for  hours with only sundays off it was common for women to take factory jobs seasonally during slack periods of farm work lack of adequate transportation long hours and poor pay made it difficult to recruit and retain workers the change in the social relationship of the factory worker compared to farmers and cottagers was viewed unfavourably by karl marx however he recognized the increase in productivity from technology standards of living some economists such as robert lucas jr say the real effect of the industrial revolution was that for the first time in history the living standards of the masses of ordinary people have begun to undergo sustained growth  nothing remotely like this economic behaviour is mentioned by the classical economists even as a theoretical possibility others argue that while growth of the economy was unprecedented living standards for most did not grow meaningfully until the late th century and workers living standards declined under early capitalism some studies estimate that wages in britain only increased  between the s and s and life expectancy did not dramatically increase until the s average height declined during the industrial revolution because nutrition was decreasing life expectancy of children increased dramatically the percentage of londoners who died before the age of five decreased from  in  to  in  the effects on living conditions have been controversial and were debated by historians from the s to the s between  and  there was a significant increase in wages food and nutrition chronic hunger and malnutrition were the norms for most including in britain and france until the late th century until about  malnutrition limited life expectancy in france to  and  in britain the us population was adequately fed taller and had a life expectancy of  though this slightly declined by the mid th century food consumption per person also declined during an episode known as the antebellum puzzle food supply in great britain was adversely affected by the corn laws  which imposed tariffs on imported grain the laws were enacted to keep prices high to benefit domestic producers the corn laws were repealed in the early years of the great irish famine the initial technologies of the industrial revolution such as mechanized textiles iron and coal did little if anything to lower food prices in britain and the netherlands food supply increased before the industrial revolution with better agricultural practices however population grew as well housing rapid population growth included the new industrial and manufacturing cities as well as service centers such as edinburgh and london the critical factor was financing which was handled by building societies that dealt directly with large contracting firms private renting from housing landlords was the dominant tenure this was usually of advantage to tenants people moved in so rapidly there was not enough capital to build adequate housing so lowincome newcomers squeezed into overcrowded slums clean water sanitation and public health facilities were inadequate the death rate was high especially infant mortality and tuberculosis among young adults cholera from polluted water and typhoid were endemic unlike rural areas there were no famines such that which devastated ireland in the s a large expose literature grew up condemning the unhealthy conditions the most famous publication was by a founder of the socialist movement in the condition of the working class in england in  friedrich engels describes backstreets of manchester and other mill towns where people lived in shanties and shacks some not enclosed some with dirt floors these shanty towns had narrow walkways between irregularly shaped lots and dwellings there were no sanitary facilities population density was extremely high however not everyone lived in such poor conditions the industrial revolution created a middle class of businessmen clerks foremen and engineers who lived in much better conditions conditions improved over the th century with new public health acts regulating things such as sewage hygiene and home construction in the introduction of his  edition engels noted most of the conditions had greatly improved for example the public health act  led to the more sanitary byelaw terraced house water and sanitation preindustrial water supply relied on gravity systems pumping water was done by water wheels and wipes were made of wood steampowered pumps and iron pipes allowed widespread piping of water to horse watering troughs and households engels book describes how untreated sewage created awful odours and turned the rivers green in industrial cities in  john snow traced a cholera outbreak in soho london to fecal contamination of a public water well by a home cesspit snows finding that cholera could be spread by contaminated water took years to be accepted but led to fundamental changes in the design of public water and waste systems in  the chemist michael faraday wrote a letter to the times on the subject of the foul condition of the river thames raw sewerage went directly into the thames and in response to the exacerbation of sanitary conditions brought on by heavy industrialisation and urbanisation londons population more than doubled between  and  making it by far the largest in the world the modern sewage system was built in london by the metropolitan board of works led by its chief engineer joseph bazalgette the london sewer system began construction in  and included  miles  km of main and  miles  km of street sewers that diverted waste to the thames estuary and by the s it would feature the revolutionary biological treatment of sewage to oxidise the waste literacy in the th century there was relatively high literacy among farmers in england and scotland this permitted the recruitment of literate craftsmen skilled workers foremen and managers who supervised textile factories and coal mines much of the labour was unskilled and especially in textile mills children as young as eight proved useful in handling chores and adding to family income children were taken out of school to work alongside their parents in the factories however by the midth century unskilled labour forces were common in western europe and british industry moved upscale needing more engineers and skilled workers who could handle technical instructions and handle complex situations literacy was essential to be hired a senior government official told parliament in  upon the speedy provision of elementary education depends are industrial prosperity it is of no use trying to give technical teaching to our citizens without elementary education uneducated labourersand many of our labourers are utterly uneducatedare for the most part unskilled labourers and if we leave our workfolk any longer unskilled notwithstanding their strong sinews and determined energy they will become overmatched in the competition of the world the invention of the paper machine and the application of steam power to the industrial processes of printing supported a massive expansion of newspaper and pamphlet publishing which contributed to rising literacy and demands for mass political participation clothing and consumer goods consumers benefited from falling prices for clothing and household articles such as cast iron cooking utensils and in the following decades stoves for cooking and space heating coffee tea sugar tobacco and chocolate became affordable to many in europe the consumer revolution in england from the th to the midth century had seen a marked increase in the consumption and variety of luxury goods and products by individuals from different economic and social backgrounds with improvements in transport and manufacturing technology opportunities for buying and selling became faster and more efficient the expanding textile trade in the north of england meant the threepiece suit became affordable to the masses founded by potter and retail entrepreneur josiah wedgwood in  wedgwood fine china and porcelain tableware was became a common feature on dining tables rising prosperity and social mobility in the th century increased those with disposable income for consumption and the marketing of goods for individuals as opposed households started to appear with the rapid growth of towns and cities shopping became an important part of everyday life window shopping and the purchase of goods became a cultural activityand many exclusive shops were opened in elegant urban districts in the strand and piccadilly in london for example and in spa towns such as bath and harrogate prosperity and expansion in manufacturing industries such as pottery and metalware increased consumer choice dramatically where once labourers ate from metal platters with wooden implements ordinary workers now dined on wedgwood porcelain consumers came to demand an array of new household goods and furnishings metal knives and forksrugs carpets mirrors cooking ranges pots pans watches clocks and a dizzying array of furniture the age of mass consumption had arrived new businesses appeared in towns and cities throughout britain confectionery

in population and per person income the population of england and wales which had remained steady at six million in  rose dramatically afterwards englands population doubled from  million in  to  million in  and by  had doubled again to  million improved conditions led to the population of britain increasing from  million to  million in the th century europes population increased from  million

abroad by the enormous demand for labour ready availability of land and cheap transportation many did not find a satisfactory life leading  million to return to europe this mass migration had large demographic effects in  less than  of the world population consisted of overseas europeans and their descendants by  they represented  the americas felt the brunt of this huge emigration largely

opportunities brought huge numbers of migrants from rural communities into urban areas in  only  of humans lived in cities compared to  by  manchester had a population of  in  by  it had burgeoned to  million effect on women and family life womens historians have debated the effect of the industrial revolution and capitalism on the status of women taking a pessimistic view alice clark argues that when capitalism arrived in thcentury england it lowered the status of women as they lost much of their economic importance clark argues that in thcentury england women were engaged in many aspects of industry and agriculture the home was a central unit of production and women played a vital role in running farms and some trades and landed estates their economic role gave them a sort of equality however clark argues as capitalism expanded there was more division of labour with husbands taking paid labour jobs outside the home and wives reduced to unpaid household work middle and upperclass women were confined to an idle domestic existence supervising servants lowerclass women were forced to take poorly paid jobs capitalism therefore had a negative effect on powerful women in a more positive interpretation ivy pinchbeck argues capitalism created the conditions for womens emancipation tilly and scott have emphasised the continuity in the status of women finding three stages in english history in the preindustrial era production was mostly for home use and women produced much of the needs of the households the second stage was the family wage economy of early industrialisation the entire family depended on the collective wages of its members including husband wife and older children the third or modern stage is the family consumer economy in which the family is the site of consumption and women are employed in large numbers in retail and clerical jobs to support rising consumption ideas of thrift and hard work characterised middleclass families as the industrial revolution swept europe these values were displayed in samuel smiles book selfhelp in which he states that the misery of the poorer classes was voluntary and selfimposedthe results of idleness thriftlessness intemperance and misconduct labour conditions social structure and working conditions harsh working conditions were prevalent long before the industrial revolution preindustrial society was very static and often cruelchild labour dirty living conditions and long working hours were just as prevalent before the industrial revolution the industrial revolution witnessed the triumph of a middle class of industrialists and businessmen over a landed class of nobility and gentry working people found increased opportunities for employment in mills and factories but these were under strict working conditions with long hours dominated by a pace set by machines as late as  most us industrial workers worked hour days yet earned  less than that necessary for a decent life most workers in textiles which was the leading industry in terms of employment were women and children for workers industrial life was a stony desert which they had to make habitable by their own efforts factories and urbanisation industrialisation led to the creation of the factory the factory system contributed to the growth of urban areas as workers migrated into the cities in search of work in the factories this was clearly illustrated in the mills and associated industries of manchester nicknamed cottonopolis and the worlds first industrial city manchester experienced a sixtimes increase in population between  and  bradford grew by  every ten years between  and  and by  only  of its population were born there for much of the th century production was done in small mills which were typically waterpowered and built to serve local needs later each factory would have its own steam engine and a chimney to give an efficient draft through its boiler some industrialists tried to improve factory and living conditions for their workers one early reformer was robert owen known for his pioneering efforts in improving conditions for at the new lanark mills and often regarded as a key thinker of the early socialist movement by  an integrated brass mill was working at warmley near bristol raw material was smelted into brass and turned into pans pins wire and other goods housing was provided for workers on site josiah wedgwood and matthew boulton were other prominent early industrialists who employed the factory system child labour the chances of surviving childhood did not improve throughout the industrial revolution although infant mortality rates were reduced markedly there was still limited opportunity for education and children were expected to work child labour had existed before but with the increase in population and education it became more visible many children were forced to work in bad conditions for much lower pay than their elders  of an adult males wage even though their productivity was comparable there was no need for strength to operate an industrial machine and since the industrial system was new there were no experienced adult labourers this made child labour the labour of choice for manufacturing in the early phases of the industrial revolution between the th and th centuries in england and scotland in  twothirds of the workers in  waterpowered cotton mills were children reports detailing some of the abuses particularly in the mines and textile factories helped to popularise the childrens plight the outcry especially among the upper and middle classes helped stir change for the young workers welfare politicians and the government tried to limit child labour by law but factory owners resisted some felt they were aiding the poor by giving their children money to buy food others simply welcomed the cheap labour in  and  the first general laws against child labour the factory acts were passed in britain children younger than nine were not allowed to work children were not permitted to work at night and the working day for those under  was limited to  hours factory inspectors enforced the law however their scarcity made this difficult a decade later the employment of children and women in mining was forbidden although laws decreased child labourers it remained significantly present in europe and the us until the th century organisation of labour the industrial revolution concentrated labour into mills factories and mines thus facilitating the organisation of combinations or trade unions advance the interests of working people a union could demand better terms by withdrawing and halting production employers had to decide between giving in at a cost or suffering the cost of the lost production skilled workers were difficult to replace and these were the first to successfully advance their conditions through this kind of bargaining the main method unions used and still use to effect change was strike action many strikes were painful events for both unions and management in britain the combination act  forbade workers to form any kind of trade union until its repeal in  even after this unions were severely restricted a british newspaper in  described unions as the most dangerous institutions that were ever permitted to take root under shelter of law in any country the reform act  extended the vote in britain but did not grant universal suffrage six men from tolpuddle in dorset founded the friendly society of agricultural labourers to protest against the lowering of wages in the s they refused to work for less than ten shillings per week by this time wages had been reduced to seven shillings and were to be reduced to six in  james frampton a local landowner wrote to prime minister lord melbourne to complain about the union invoking an obscure law from  prohibiting people from swearing oaths to each other which the members of the society had done six men were arrested found guilty and transported to australia they became known as the tolpuddle martyrs in the s and s the chartist movement was the first largescale organised workingclass political movement that campaigned for political equality and social justice its charter of reforms received three million signatures but was rejected by parliament without consideration working people formed friendly societies and cooperative societies as mutual support groups against times of economic hardship enlightened industrialists such as robert owen supported these organisations to improve conditions unions slowly overcame the legal restrictions on the right to strike in  a general strike involving cotton workers and colliers was organised through the chartist movement which stopped production across britain eventually effective political organisation for working people was achieved through trades unions who after the extensions of the franchise in  and  began to support socialist parties that merged to become the british labour party luddites the rapid industrialisation of the english economy cost many craft workers their jobs the luddite movement started first with lace and hosiery workers near nottingham and spread to other areas of the textile industry many weavers found themselves suddenly unemployed as they could no longer compete with machines which required less skilled labour to produce more cloth than one weaver many unemployed workers and others turned their animosity towards the machines that had taken their jobs and began destroying factories and machinery these attackers became known as luddites supposedly followers of ned ludd a folklore figure the first attacks of the movement began in  the luddites rapidly gained popularity and the government took drastic measures using the militia or army to protect industry rioters who were caught were tried and hanged or transported for life unrest continued in other sectors as they industrialised such as with agricultural labourers in the s when large parts of southern britain were affected by the captain swing disturbances threshing machines were a particular target and hayrick burning was a popular activity the riots led to the first formation of trade unions and further pressure for reform shift in productions centre of gravity the traditional centres of hand textile production such as india the middle east and china could not withstand competition from machinemade textiles which destroyed the handmade textile industries and left millions without work many of whom starved the industrial revolution generated an enormous and unprecedented economic division in the world as measured by the share of manufacturing output cotton and the expansion of slavery cheap cotton textiles increased demand for raw cotton previously it had primarily been consumed in subtropical regions where it was grown with little raw cotton available for export consequently prices of raw cotton rose british production grew from  million pounds in  to  million in  to  million in  the invention of the cotton gin by american eli whitney in  was the decisive event it allowed greenseeded cotton to become profitable leading to the widespread growth of slave plantations in the us brazil and the west indies in  american cotton production was  million pounds soaring to  million by  half of which was exported americas cotton plantations were highly efficient profitable and able to keep up with demand the us civil war created a cotton famine that led to increased production in other areas of the world including european colonies in africa effect on environment the origins of the environmental movement lay in the response to increasing levels of smoke pollution during the industrial revolution the emergence of great factories and the linked immense growth in coal consumption gave rise to an unprecedented level of air pollution in industrial centres after  the large volume of industrial chemical discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste the first largescale modern environmental laws came in the form of britains alkali act  to regulate the air pollution given off by the leblanc process used to produce soda ash alkali inspectors were appointed to curb this pollution the manufactured gas industry began in british cities in  this produced highly toxic effluent dumped into sewers and rivers the gas companies were repeatedly sued in nuisance lawsuits they usually lost and modified the worst practices the city of london indicted gas companies in the s for polluting the thames poisoning its fish parliament wrote company charters to regulate toxicity the industry reached the us around  causing pollution and lawsuits in industrial cities local experts and reformers especially after  took the lead in identifying environmental degradation and pollution and initiating grassroots movements to achieve reforms typically the highest priority went to water and air pollution the coal smoke abatement society was formed in britain in  it was founded by artist william blake richmond frustrated with the pall cast by coal smoke although there were earlier pieces of legislation the public health act  required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their smoke it provided for sanctions against factories that emitted large amounts of black smoke beyond great britain europe the industrial revolution in continental europe started in belgium and france then spread to german states by the middle of the th century in many industries this involved the application of technology developed in britain typically the technology was purchased from britain or british engineers and entrepreneurs moved abroad in search of opportunities by  part of the ruhr in westphalia was called miniature england because of its similarities most european governments provided state funding to the new industries in some cases such as iron the different availability of resources locally meant only some aspects of the british technology were adopted belgium belgium was the second country in which the industrial revolution took place thanks to coal wallonia in south belgium took the lead starting in the s and especially after belgium became independent in  factories comprising coke blast furnaces as well as puddling and rolling mills were built in the coal mining areas around liege and charleroi the leader was john cockerill a transplanted englishman his factories at seraing integrated all stages of production from engineering to the supply of raw materials as early as  wallonia exemplified the radical evolution of industrial expansion it was also the birthplace of a strong socialist party and trade unions with its sillon industriel especially in the haine sambre and meuse valleysthere was a huge industrial development based on coalmining and ironmaking philippe raxhon wrote about the period after  it was not propaganda but a reality the walloon regions were becoming the second industrial powerafter britain the sole industrial centre outside the collieries and blast furnaces of walloon was the old clothmaking town of ghent many thcentury coal mines in wallonia are now protected as world heritage sites though belgium was the second industrial country after britain the effect of the industrial revolution was different in breaking stereotypes muriel neven and isabelle devious say the industrial revolution changed a mainly rural society into an urban one but with a strong contrast between northern and southern belgium during the middle ages and the early modern period flanders was characterised by the presence of large urban centresat the beginning of the nineteenth centuryflanderswith an urbanisation degree of more than  percent remained one of the most urbanised in the world by comparison this proportion reached only  percent in wallonia barely  percent in most west european countries  percent in france and  percent in britain thcentury industrialisation did not affect the traditional urban infrastructure except in ghent also in wallonia the traditional urban network was largely unaffected by the industrialisation process even though the proportion of citydwellers rose from  to  percent between  and  especially in the haine sambre and meuse valleyswhere there was a huge industrial development based on coalmining and ironmaking urbanisation was fastnevertheless industrialisation remained quite traditional in the sense that it did not lead to the growth of modern and large urban centres but to a conurbation of industrial villages and towns developed around a coal mine or a factory communication routes between these small centres only became populated later and created a much less dense urban morphology france the industrial revolution in france did not correspond to the main model followed by other countries most french historians argue france did not go through a clear takeoff instead economic growth and industrialisation was slow and steady through the th and th centuries however some stages were identified by maurice levyleboyer french revolution and napoleonic wars  industrialisation along with britain  economic slowdown  renewal of growth after  germany germanys political disunitywith three dozen statesand a pervasive conservatism made it difficult to build railways in the s however by the s trunk lines linked the major cities each german state was responsible for the lines within its borders lacking a technological base at first the germans imported their engineering and hardware from britain but quickly learned the skills needed to operate and expand the railways in many cities the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training so that by  germany was selfsufficient in meeting the demands of railway construction and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry observers found that even as late as  their engineering was inferior to britains however german unification in  stimulated consolidation nationalisation into stateowned companies and further rapid growth unlike in france the goal was the support of industrialisation and so heavy lines crisscrossed the ruhr and other industrial districts and provided good connections to the major ports of hamburg and bremen by  germany had  locomotives pulling  passengers and  tons of freight and pulled ahead of france based on its leadership in chemical research in universities and industrial laboratories germany became dominant in the worlds chemical industry in the late th century sweden between  sweden experienced parallel economic movements an agricultural revolution with larger agricultural estates new crops and farming tools and commercialisation of farming and a proto industrialisation with small industries established in the countryside and workers switching between agriculture in summer and industrial production in winter this led to economic growth benefiting the population and leading to a consumption revolution in the s between  the protoindustries developed into specialised and larger industries this period witnessed regional specialisation with mining in bergslagen textile mills in sjuharadsbygden and forestry in norrland important institutional changes took place such as free and mandatory schooling introduced in  first time in the world abolition of the monopoly on trade in handicrafts in  and a stock company law in  from  to  there was a rapid expansion in exports dominated by crops wood and steel sweden abolished most tariffs and other barriers to free trade in the s and joined the gold standard in  large infrastructural investments were made mainly in the expanding railroad network which was financed by the government and private enterprises from  to  new industries developed with their focus on the domestic market mechanical engineering power utilities papermaking and textile austriahungary the habsburg realms which became austriahungary in  had a population of  million in  growing to  million by  between  industrial growth averaged  annually though development varied across regions a boost to industrialisation came with the construction of the rail network between  which transformed transport by making it faster more reliable and affordable protoindustrialisation had begun by  in alpine and bohemian regionsnow the czech republicwhich emerged as the industrial hub of the empire the textile industry led this transformation adopting mechanisation steam engines and the factory system the first mechanical loom in the czech lands was introduced in varnsdorf in  followed shortly by the arrival of steam engines in bohemia and moravia textile production flourished in industrial centers such as prague and brnothe latter earning the nickname moravian manchester the czech lands became an industrial heartland due to rich natural resources skilled workforce and early adoption of technology the iron industry also expanded in the alpine regions after  hungary by contrast remained predominantly rural and underindustrialised until after  however reformers like count istvan szechenyi played a crucial role in laying the groundwork for future development often called the greatest hungarian szechenyi advocated for economic modernisation infrastructure development and industrial education his initiatives included the promotion of river regulation bridge construction and the founding of the hungarian academy of sciencesall aimed at fostering a marketoriented economy in  prague hosted the first worlds fair in clementinum showcasing the regions growing industrial sophistication an earlier industrial exhibition was held in conjunction with the coronation of leopold ii as king of bohemia celebrating advanced manufacturing techniques in the czech lands from  to  technological innovation drove industrialisation and urbanisation across the empire gross national product gnp per capita grew at an average annual rate of surpassing britain  france  and germany  nevertheless austriahungary as a whole continued to lag behind more industrialised powers like britain and germany largely due to its later start in the modernisation process japan the industrial revolution began about  as meiji period leaders decided to catch up with the west the government built railways improved roads and inaugurated a land reform program to prepare the country for further development it inaugurated a new westernbased education system for young people sent thousands of students to the us and europe and hired more than  westerners to teach modern science mathematics technology and foreign languages in  a group of japanese politicians known as the iwakura mission toured europe and the us to learn western ways the result was a deliberate stateled industrialisation policy to enable japan to quickly catch up the bank of japan founded in  used taxes to fund model steel and textile factories modern industry first appeared in textiles including cotton and especially silk which was based in home workshops in rural areas united states during the late th and early th centuries when western europe began to industrialise the us was primarily an agricultural and natural resource producing and processing economy the building of roads and canals the introduction of steamboats and the building of railroads were important for handling agricultural and natural resource products in the large and sparsely populated country important american technological contributions were the cotton gin and the development of a system for making interchangeable parts which was aided by the development of the milling machine in the us the development of machine tools and system of interchangeable parts was the basis for the rise of the us as the worlds leading industrial nation in the late th century oliver evans invented an automated flour mill in the mids that used control mechanisms and conveyors so no labour was needed from when grain was loaded into the elevator buckets until the flour was discharged into a wagon this is considered to be the first modern materials handling system an important advance in the progress toward mass production the us originally used horsepowered machinery for smallscale applications such as grain milling but eventually switched to water power after textile factories began being built in the s as a result industrialisation was concentrated in new england and the northeastern united states which has fastmoving rivers the newer waterpowered production lines proved more economical than horsedrawn production in the late th century steampowered manufacturing overtook waterpowered manufacturing allowing the industry to spread to the midwest thomas somers and the cabot brothers founded the beverly cotton manufactory in  the first cotton mill in america the largest cotton mill of its era and a significant milestone in the research and development of cotton mills this mill was designed to use horsepower but the operators quickly learned that the horsedrawn platform was economically unstable and had losses for years despite this the manufactory served as a playground of innovation both in turning a large amount of cotton but also developing the waterpowered milling structure used in slaters mill in  samuel slater  founded the slater mill at pawtucket rhode island he had learned of the new textile technologies as a boy apprentice in derbyshire england and defied laws against the emigration of skilled workers by leaving for new york in  hoping to make money with his knowledge after founding slaters mill he went on to own  textile mills daniel day established a wool carding mill in the blackstone valley at uxbridge massachusetts in  the third woollen mill established in the us the blackstone valley national heritage corridor retraces the history of americas hardestworking river blackstone river which with its tributaries cover more than  kilometres  mi at its peak over  mills operated in this valley including slaters mill merchant francis cabot lowell from newburyport massachusetts memorised the design of textile machines on his tour of british factories in  the war of  ruined his import business but realising demand for domesticfinished cloth was emerging in america on his return he set up the boston manufacturing company lowell and his partners built americas second cottontocloth textile mill at waltham massachusetts second to the beverly cotton manufactory after his death in  his associates built americas first planned factory town which they named after him this enterprise was capitalised in a public stock offering one of the first uses of it in the us lowell massachusetts using nine kilometres  miles of canals and  kilowatts  horsepower delivered by the merrimack river the shortlived utopialike walthamlowell system was formed as a direct response to the poor working conditions in britain however by  especially following the great famine of ireland the system had been replaced by poor immigrant labour a major us contribution to industrialisation was the development of techniques to make interchangeable parts from metal precision metal machining techniques were developed by the us department of war to make interchangeable parts for firearms techniques included using fixtures to hold the parts in the proper position jigs to guide the cutting tools and precision blocks and gauges to measure the accuracy the milling machine a fundamental machine tool is believed to have been invented by eli whitney who was a government contractor who built firearms as part of this program another important invention was the blanchard lathe invented by thomas blanchard the blanchard lathe was actually a shaper that could produce copies of wooden gun stocks the use of machinery and the techniques for producing standardised and interchangeable parts became known as the american system of manufacturing precision manufacturing techniques made it possible to build machines that mechanised the shoe and watch industries the industrialisation of the watch industry started in  also in waltham massachusetts at the waltham watch company with the development of machine tools gauges and assembling methods adapted to the micro precision required for watches second industrial revolution steel is often cited as the first of several new areas for industrial massproduction which are said to characterise a second industrial revolution beginning around  although a method for mass manufacture of steel was not invented until the s when henry bessemer invented a new furnace which could convert molten pig iron into steel in large quantities however it only became widely available in the s after the process was modified to produce more uniform quality this second industrial revolution gradually grew to include chemicals mainly the chemical industries petroleum and in the th century the automotive industry and was marked by a transition of technological leadership from britain to the us and germany the increasing availability of economical petroleum products also reduced the importance of coal and widened the potential for industrialisation a new revolution began with electricity and electrification in the electrical industries by the s industrialisation had created the first giant industrial corporations with burgeoning global interests as companies like us steel general electric standard oil and bayer ag joined the railroad and ship companies on the worlds stock markets causes the causes of the industrial revolution were complicated and remain debated geographic factors include britains vast mineral resources in addition to metal ores britain had the highest quality coal reserves known at the time as well as abundant water power highly productive agriculture numerous seaports and navigable waterways some historians believe the industrial revolution was an outgrowth of social and institutional changes brought by the end of feudalism in britain after the english civil war in the th century although feudalism began to break down after the black death of the mid th century the enclosure movement and the british agricultural revolution made food production more efficient and less labourintensive forcing farmers no longer selfsufficient into cottage industry for example weaving and in the longer term into the cities and newly developed factories the colonial expansion of the th century with the accompanying development of international trade creation of financial markets and accumulation of capital are cited as factors as is the scientific revolution of the th century a change to getting married later made people able to accumulate more human capital during their youth thereby encouraging economic development until the s it was believed technological innovation was the heart of the industrial revolution and the key enabling technology was the invention of the steam engine lewis mumford has proposed that the industrial revolution had its origins in the early middle ages earlier than most estimates he explains that the model for standardised mass production was the printing press and that the archetypal model for the industrial era was the clock he cites the monastic emphasis on order and timekeeping and the fact medieval cities had at their centre a church with bell ringing at regular intervals as necessary precursors to a synchronisation necessary for later manifestations such as the steam engine anthropologist joseph henrich also argues for an origin in the early middle ages but specifically identifies the primary cause as the dissolution of european kinship networks under pressure from the catholic church the presence of a large domestic market is considered an important driver of the industrial revolution particularly explaining why it occurred in britain in other nations such as france markets were split up by local regions which often imposed tolls and tariffs on goods traded among them internal tariffs were abolished by henry viii of england they survived in russia until   in france and  in spain governments grant of limited monopolies to inventors under a developing patent system is considered an influential factor the effects of patents on the development of industrialisation are clearly illustrated in the history of the steam engine in return for publicly revealing the workings of an invention patents rewarded inventors such as james watt by allowing them to monopolise production and increasing the pace of technological development however monopolies bring inefficiencies which counterbalance or even overbalance the benefits of publicising ingenuity and rewarding inventors watts monopoly prevented other inventors from introducing improved steam engines thereby slowing the spread of steam power causes in europe a question of active interest is why the industrial revolution occurred in europe and not elsewhere particularly china india and the middle east which pioneered in shipbuilding textiles and water mills between  or at other times like in classical antiquity or the middle ages one account argues europeans have been characterized for millennia by a freedomloving culture originating from the aristocratic societies of indoeuropean invaders many historians however have challenged this as being not only eurocentric but ignoring historical context in fact before the industrial revolution there existed something of a global economic parity between the most advanced regions in the world economy these historians have suggested other factors including education technological changes modern government modern work attitudes ecology and culture china was the most technologically advanced country for centuries however it stagnated and was surpassed by europe before the age of discovery by which time china banned imports and denied entry to foreigners it taxed transported goods heavily modern estimates of per capita income in western europe in the late th century are roughly  dollars in purchasing power parity whereas china had only  dollars india was feudal politically fragmented and not as advanced as western europe historians such as david landes and sociologists max weber and rodney stark credit the different belief systems in asia and europe with dictating where the revolution occurred the religion and beliefs of europe were products of judeochristian and greek thought chinese society was founded on men like confucius mencius han feizi and buddha resulting in different worldviews other factors include the considerable distance of chinas coal deposits from its cities as well as the then unnavigable yellow river that connects deposits to the sea historian joel mokyr argued political fragmentation the presence of many european states made it possible for heterodox ideas to thrive as entrepreneurs innovators ideologues and heretics could easily move to a neighboring state if one state suppressed their ideas and activities this is what set europe apart from the technologically advanced large unitary empires such as china by providing an insurance against economic and technological stagnation china had a printing press and movable type and india had similar scientific and technological achievement as europe in  yet the industrial revolution occurred in europe first in europe political fragmentation was coupled with an integrated market for ideas where europes intellectuals used the lingua franca of latin had a shared intellectual basis in europes classical heritage and the paneuropean institution of the republic of letters political institutions could contribute to the relation between democratization and economic growth during the great divergence europes monarchs desperately needed revenue pushing them into alliances with their merchant classes groups of merchants were granted monopolies and taxcollecting responsibilities in exchange for payments to the state located in a region at the hub of the largest and most varied network of exchange in history europe advanced as the leader of the industrial revolution in the americas europeans found a windfall of silver timber fish and maize leading peter stearns to conclude that europes industrial revolution which was to have such dramatic effects on the wider world stemmed in great part from europes changing position in the wider world and a particular desire to catch up or surpass asian manufacturing competitors modern capitalism originated in the italian citystates around the end of the first millennium the citystates were prosperous cities that were independent from feudal lords they were republics whose governments were composed of merchants manufacturers members of guilds bankers and financiers the citystates built a network of branch banks in western european cities and introduced double entry bookkeeping italian commerce was supported by schools that taught numeracy in financial calculations through abacus schools causes in britain britain provided the legal and cultural foundations that enabled entrepreneurs to pioneer the industrial revolution key factors were the period of peace and stability which followed the unification of england and scotland no internal trade barriers including between england and scotland or feudal tolls and tariffs making britain the largest coherent market in europe the rule of law enforcing property rights and contracts a straightforward legal system that allowed the formation of jointstock companies corporations geographic and natural resource advantages extensive coastlines and many navigable rivers in an age where water was the easiest means of transport britain had the highest quality coal in europe and many sites for water power there were two main values that drove the industrial revolution in britain selfinterest and entrepreneurial spirit because of these many advances were made that resulted in a huge increase in personal wealth and a consumer revolution these advancements benefitted british society as a whole countries recognised the advancements and used them to begin their own revolutions a debate sparked by eric williams in his work capitalism and slavery  concerned the role of slavery in financing the industrial revolution williams argued european capital amassed from slavery was vital in the early years of the revolution this led to historiographical debate with seymour drescher critiquing williams arguments in econocide  the greater liberalisation of trade from a large merchant base may have allowed britain to produce and use emerging scientific and technological developments more effectively than countries with stronger monarchies britain emerged from the napoleonic wars as the only european nation not ravaged by financial plunder and with the only significant merchant fleet britains extensive exporting cottage industries ensured markets were already available for early forms of manufactured goods most british warfare was conducted overseas reducing the devastating effects of territorial conquest that affected much of europe this was further aided by britains geographical positionan island separated from the rest of europe britain was able to succeed due to the key resources it possessed and population density enclosure of common land and the related agricultural revolution made supply of labour readily available there was a local coincidence of natural resources in the north of england the midlands south wales and the scottish lowlands local supplies of coal iron lead copper tin limestone and water power resulted in excellent conditions for the development and expansion of industry also the damp mild weather conditions of the north west of england provided ideal conditions for the spinning of cotton providing a natural starting point for the birth of the textiles industry the stable political situation in britain from  following the glorious revolution and societys greater receptiveness to change than other european countries can be said to be factors favouring the industrial revolution reinforcement of confidence in the rule of law which followed establishment of the prototype of constitutional monarchy in  and the emergence of a stable financial market based on the management of the national debt by the bank of england contributed to the capacity for private financial investment in industrial ventures peasant resistance to industrialisation was eliminated by the enclosure movement and the landed classes developed commercial interests that made them pioneers in removing obstacles to capitalism taking refuge in england in  voltaire wrote about commerce and religious diversity in letters on the english  noting why england was more prosperous compared to less religiously tolerant european neighbours take a view of the royal exchange in london a place more venerable than many courts of justice where the representatives of all nations meet for the benefit of mankind there the jew the mahometan muslim and the christian transact together as though they all professed the same religion and give the name of infidel to none but bankrupts there the presbyterian confides in the anabaptist and the churchman depends on the quakers word if one religion only were allowed in england the government would very possibly become arbitrary if there were but two the people would cut one anothers throats but as there are such a multitude they all live happy and in peace britains population grew  from  to  while the rest of western europe grew   of european urbanisation happened in britain from  to  by  only the netherlands was more urbanised this was only possible because coal coke imported cotton brick and slate had replaced wood charcoal flax peat and thatch the latter compete with land grown to feed people while mined materials do not yet more land would be freed when chemical fertilisers replaced manure and horses work was mechanised a workhorse needs  to  ha  to  acres for fodder while even early steam engines produced four times more mechanical energy in  fivesixths of the coal mined worldwide was in britain while the netherlands had none so despite having europes best transport lowest taxes and most urbanised wellpaid and literate population it did not industrialise without coal britain would have run out of suitable river sites for mills by the s based on science and experimentation from the continent the steam engine was developed for pumping water out of mines many of which in britain had been mined to below the water table although inefficient they were economical because they used unsaleable coal iron rails were developed to transport coal which was a major economic sector in britain bob allen has argued that high wages cheap capital and very cheap energy in britain made it the ideal place for the industrial revolution these factors made it vastly more profitable to invest in research and development and put technology to use than other societies however  studies in the economic history review showed wages were not particularly high in spinning or construction sectors casting doubt on allens explanation a  study found industrialization happened in areas with low wages and high mechanical skills whereas literacy banks and proximity to coal had little explanatory power protestant work ethic another theory is that the british advance was due to the presence of an entrepreneurial class which believed in progress technology and hard work the existence of this class is often linked to the protestant work ethic and particular status of baptists and dissenting protestant sects such as the quakers and presbyterians english dissenters were barred or discouraged from almost all public offices as well as education at englands only two universities when the restoration of the monarchy took place in  and membership in the official anglican church became mandatory due to the test act they thereupon became active in banking manufacturing and education the unitarians were very involved in education by running dissenting academies where in contrast to the universities of oxford and cambridge and schools such as eton and harrow much attention was given to mathematics and the sciences vital to the development of manufacturing technologies historians sometimes consider this social factor to be important while members of these sects were excluded from certain circles of the government they were considered fellow protestants by many in the middle class such as financiers or other businessmen given this tolerance and the supply of capital the natural outlet for more enterprising members of these sects was in new opportunities in the technologies created in the wake of the scientific revolution of the th century transfer of knowledge knowledge of innovation was spread by several means workers trained in a technique might move to another employer a common method was the study tour in which individuals gathered information abroad throughout the industrial revolution and preceding century european countries and america engaged in such tours sweden and france trained civil servants and technicians to undertake them as policy while in britain and america manufacturers pursued tours independently tour diaries are invaluable records of methods innovation spread via informal networks such as the lunar society of birmingham whose members met from  to  to discuss natural philosophy and its industrial applications they have been described as the revolutionary committee of that most farreaching of all the eighteenthcentury revolutions the industrial revolution similar societies published papers and proceedings the royal society of arts issued annual transactions and illustrated volumes of inventions technical encyclopaedias disseminated methods john harriss lexicon technicum  offered extensive scientific and engineering entries abraham reess the cyclopaedia or universal dictionary of arts sciences and literature  contained detailed articles and engraved plates on machines and processes french works such as the descriptions des arts et metiers and diderots encyclopedie similarly documented foreign techniques with engraved illustrations periodicals on manufacturing and patents emerged in the s for instance french journals like the annales des mines printed engineers travel reports on british factories helping diffuse innovations criticisms the industrial revolution has been criticised for causing ecosystem collapse mental illness pollution and detrimental social systems it has also been criticised for valuing profits and corporate growth over life and wellbeing multiple movements have arisen which reject aspects of the industrial revolution such as the amish or primitivists humanism and harsh conditions some humanists and individualists criticise the industrial revolution for mistreating women and children and turning men into work machines that lacked autonomy critics of the industrial revolution promoted a more interventionist state and formed new organisations to promote human rights primitivism primitivism argues that the industrial revolution has created an unnatural frame of society and the world in which humans need to adapt to an unnatural urban landscape in which humans are perpetual cogs without personal autonomy certain primitivists argue for a return to preindustrial society while others argue that technology such as modern medicine and agriculture are all positive for humanity assuming they are controlled by and serve humanity and have no effect on the natural environment pollution and ecological collapse the industrial revolution has been criticised for leading to immense ecological and habitat destruction it has led to immense decrease in the biodiversity of life on earth the industrial revolution has been said to be inherently unsustainable and will lead to eventual collapse of society mass hunger starvation and resource scarcity opposition from romanticism during the industrial revolution an intellectual and artistic hostility towards the new industrialisation developed associated with the romantic movement romanticism revered the traditionalism of rural life and recoiled against the upheavals caused by industrialisation urbanisation and the wretchedness of the working classes its major exponents in english included the artist and poet william blake and poets william wordsworth samuel taylor coleridge john keats lord byron and percy bysshe shelley the movement stressed the importance of nature in art and language in contrast to monstrous machines and factories the dark satanic mills of blakes poem and did those feet in ancient time mary shelleys frankenstein reflected concerns that scientific progress might be twoedged french romanticism likewise was highly critical of industry see
