the european organization for nuclear research known as cern  french pronunciation sn organisation europeenne pour la recherche nucleaire is an intergovernmental organization that operates the largest particle physics laboratory in the world established in  it is based in meyrin a western suburb of geneva on the franceswitzerland border it comprises  member states israel admitted in  is the only full member geographically out of europe cern is an official united nations general assembly observer the acronym cern is also used to refer to the laboratory in  it had  scientific technical and administrative staff members and hosted about  users from institutions in more than  countries in  cern generated  petabytes of data cerns main function is to provide the particle accelerators and other infrastructure needed for highenergy physics research  consequently numerous experiments have been constructed at cern through international collaborations cern is the site of the large hadron collider lhc the worlds largest and highestenergy particle collider the main site at meyrin hosts a large computing facility which is primarily used to store and analyze data from experiments as well as simulate events as researchers require remote access to these facilities the lab has historically been a major wide area network hub cern is also the birthplace of the world wide web history the convention establishing cern was ratified on  september  by  countries in western europe the acronym cern originally represented the french words for conseil europeen pour la recherche nucleaire european council for nuclear research which was a provisional council for building the laboratory established by  european governments in  during these early years the council worked at the university of copenhagen under the direction of niels bohr before moving to its present site near geneva the acronym was retained for the new laboratory after the provisional council was dissolved even though the name changed to the current organisation europeenne pour la recherche nucleaire european organization for nuclear research in  according to lew kowarski a former director of cern when the name was changed the abbreviation could have become the awkward oern and werner heisenberg said that this could still be cern even if the name is not cerns first president was sir benjamin lockspeiser edoardo amaldi was the general secretary of cern at its early stages when operations were still provisional and the first directorgeneral  was felix bloch founding members at the sixth session of the cern council in paris from  june to  july  the convention establishing the organization was signed subject to ratification by  states the convention was gradually ratified by the  founding member states belgium denmark france the federal republic of germany greece italy the netherlands norway sweden switzerland the united kingdom and yugoslavia scientific achievements several major achievements in particle physics have occurred in experiments at cern they include  the discovery of neutral currents in the gargamelle bubble chamber  the discovery of w and z bosons in the ua and ua experiments  the determination of the number of light neutrino families at the large electronpositron collider lep operating on the z boson peak  the first creation of antihydrogen atoms in the ps experiment  precision measurement of the z lineshape based predominantly on lep data collected on the z resonance from  to   the discovery of direct cp violation in the na experiment  the heavy ion programme discovered a new state of matter quarkgluon plasma  the isolation of  atoms of antihydrogen  maintaining antihydrogen for over  minutes  the discovery of a boson with mass around  gevc consistent with the longsought higgs boson in september  cern attracted media attention when the opera collaboration reported the detection of possibly fasterthanlight neutrinos further tests showed that the results were flawed due to an incorrectly connected gps synchronization cable the  nobel prize for physics was awarded to carlo rubbia and simon van der meer for the developments that resulted in the discoveries of the w and z bosons the  nobel prize for physics was awarded to cern staff researcher georges charpak for his invention and development of particle detectors in particular the multiwire proportional chamber the  nobel prize for physics was awarded to francois englert and peter higgs for the theoretical description of the higgs mechanism in the year after the higgs boson was found by cern experiments computer science cern pioneered the introduction of tcpip for its intranet beginning in  this played an influential role in the adoption of the tcpip in europe see history of the internet and protocol wars in  the world wide web was invented at cern by tim bernerslee based on the concept of hypertext the idea was designed to facilitate information sharing between researchers this stemmed from bernerslees earlier work at cern on a database named enquire a colleague robert cailliau became involved in  in  bernerslee and cailliau were jointly honoured by the association for computing machinery for their contributions to the development of the world wide web a copy of the first webpage created by bernerslee is still published on the world wide web consortiums website as a historical document the first website was activated in  on  april  cern announced that the world wide web would be free to anyone it became the dominant way through which most users interact with the internet more recently cern has become a facility for the development of grid computing hosting projects including the enabling grids for escience egee and lhc computing grid it also hosts the cern internet exchange point cixp one of the two main internet exchange points in switzerland as of  cern employs ten times more engineers and technicians than research physicists particle accelerators current complex cern operates a network of seven accelerators and two decelerators and some additional small accelerators each machine in the chain increases the energy of particle beams before delivering them to experiments or to the next more powerful accelerator the decelerators naturally decrease the energy of particle beams before delivering them to experiments or further acceleratorsdecelerators before an experiment is able to use the network of accelerators it must be approved by the various scientific committees of cern currently as of  active machines are the lhc accelerator and the linac  linear accelerator generating low energy particles it provides heavy ions at  mevda for injection into the low energy ion ring leir the low energy ion ring leir accelerates the ions from the ion linear accelerator linac  before transferring them to the proton synchrotron ps this accelerator was commissioned in  after having been reconfigured from the previous low energy antiproton ring lear the linac linear accelerator accelerates negative hydrogen ions to an energy of  mev the ions are then injected to the proton synchrotron booster psb where both electrons are then stripped from each of the hydrogen ions and thus only the nucleus containing one proton remains the protons are then used in experiments or accelerated further in other cern accelerators linac serves as the source of all proton beams for cern experiments the proton synchrotron booster increases the energy of particles generated by the proton linear accelerator before they are transferred to the other accelerators the  gev proton synchrotron ps built during  and still operating as a feeder to the more powerful sps and to many of cerns experiments the super proton synchrotron sps a circular accelerator with a diameter of  kilometres built in a tunnel which started operation in  it was designed to deliver an energy of  gev and was gradually upgraded to  gev as well as having its own beamlines for fixedtarget experiments currently compass and na it has been operated as a protonantiproton collider the spps collider and for accelerating high energy electrons and positrons which were injected into the large electronpositron collider lep since  it has been used to inject protons and heavy ions into the large hadron collider lhc the online isotope mass separator isolde which is used to study unstable nuclei the radioactive ions are produced by the impact of protons at an energy of  gev from the proton synchrotron booster it was first commissioned in  and was rebuilt with major upgrades in  and  the antiproton decelerator ad which reduces the velocity of antiprotons to about  of the speed of light for research of antimatter the ad machine was reconfigured from the previous antiproton collector ac machine the extra low energy antiproton ring elena which takes antiprotons from ad and decelerates them into low energies speeds for use in antimatter experiments the awake experiment which is a proofofprinciple plasma wakefield accelerator the cern linear electron accelerator for research clear accelerator research and development facility large hadron collider many activities at cern currently involve operating the large hadron collider lhc and the experiments for it the lhc represents a largescale worldwide scientific cooperation project the lhc tunnel is located  metres underground in the region between geneva international airport and the nearby jura mountains the majority of its length is on the french side of the border it uses the  km circumference circular tunnel previously occupied by the large electronpositron collider lep which was shut down in november  cerns existing pssps accelerator complexes are used to preaccelerate protons and lead ions which are then injected into the lhc eight experiments cms atlas lhcb moedal totem lhcf faser and alice are located along the collider each of them studies particle collisions from a different aspect and with different technologies construction for these experiments required an extraordinary engineering effort for example a special crane was rented from belgium to lower pieces of the cms detector into its cavern since each piece weighed nearly  tons the first of the approximately  magnets necessary for construction was lowered down a special shaft at in march  the lhc has begun to generate vast quantities of data which cern streams to laboratories around the world for distributed processing making use of a specialized grid infrastructure the lhc computing grid in april  a trial successfully streamed  mbs to seven different sites across the world in august  the initial particle beams were injected into the lhc the first beam was circulated through the entire lhc on  september  but the system failed  days later because of a faulty magnet connection and it was stopped for repairs on  september  the lhc resumed operation on  november  by successfully circulating two beams each with an energy of  teraelectronvolts tev the challenge for the engineers was then to line up the two beams so that they smashed into each other this is like firing two needles across the atlantic and getting them to hit each other according to stephen myers director for accelerators and technology on  march  the lhc successfully collided two proton beams with  tev of energy per proton resulting in a  tev collision energy this was enough to start the main research program including the search for the higgs boson when the  tev experimental period ended the lhc increased to  tev  tev per proton starting march  and soon began particle collisions at that energy in july  cern scientists announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle that was later confirmed to be the higgs boson in march  cern announced that the measurements performed on the newly found particle allowed it to conclude that it was a higgs boson in early  the lhc was deactivated for a twoyear maintenance period to strengthen the electrical connections between magnets inside the accelerator and for other upgrades on  april  after two years of maintenance and consolidation the lhc restarted for a second run the first ramp to the recordbreaking energy of  tev was performed on  april  in  the design collision rate was exceeded for the first time a second twoyear period of shutdown begun at the end of  accelerators under construction as of october  the construction is ongoing to upgrade the lhcs luminosity in a project called high luminosity lhc hllhc this project should see the lhc accelerator upgraded by  to an order of magnitude higher luminosity as part of the hllhc upgrade project also other cern accelerators and their subsystems are receiving upgrades among other work the linac  linear accelerator injector was decommissioned and replaced by a new injector accelerator the linac decommissioned accelerators the original linear accelerator linac  operated  the linac  linear accelerator injector accelerated protons to  mev for injection into the proton synchrotron booster psb operated  the  mev synchrocyclotron sc which started operation in  and was shut down in  was made into a public exhibition in  the intersecting storage rings isr an early collider built from  to  and operated until  the super protonantiproton synchrotron spps operated  a modification of super proton synchrotron sps to operate as a protonantiproton collider the large electronpositron collider lep which operated  and was the largest machine of its kind housed in a  kmlong circular tunnel which now houses the large hadron collider the lep preinjector lpi accelerator complex consisting of two accelerators a linear accelerator called lep injector linac lil itself consisting of two backtoback linear accelerators called lil v and lil w and a circular accelerator called electron positron accumulator epa the purpose of these accelerators was to inject positron and electron beams into the cern accelerator complex more precisely to the proton synchrotron to be delivered to lep after many stages of acceleration operational  after the shutdown of lep and the completion of experiments that were directly fed by the lpi the lpi facility was adapted to be used for the clic test facility  ctf the low energy antiproton ring lear was commissioned in  lear assembled the first pieces of true antimatter in  consisting of nine atoms of antihydrogen it was closed in  and superseded by the antiproton decelerator the lear apparatus itself was reconfigured into the low energy ion ring leir ion booster the antiproton accumulator aa built  operations ended in  and the machine was dismantled stored antiprotons produced by the proton synchrotron ps for use in other experiments and accelerators for example the isr spps and lear for later half of its working life operated in tandem with antiproton collector ac to form the antiproton accumulation complex aac the antiproton collector ac built  operations ended in  and the machine was converted into the antiproton decelerator ad which is the successor machine for low energy antiproton ring lear operated in tandem with antiproton accumulator aa and the pair formed the antiproton accumulation complex aac whose purpose was to store antiprotons produced by the proton synchrotron ps for use in other experiments and accelerators like the low energy antiproton ring lear and super protonantiproton synchrotron spps the compact linear collider test facility  ctf which studied feasibility for the future normal conducting linear collider project the clic collider in operation  one of its beamlines has been converted from  on into the new cern linear electron accelerator for research clear facility possible future accelerators cern in collaboration with groups worldwide is investigating two main concepts for future accelerators a linear electronpositron collider with a new acceleration concept to increase the energy clic and a larger version of the lhc a project currently named future circular collider sites the smaller accelerators are on the main meyrin site also known as the west area which was originally built in switzerland alongside the french border but has been extended to span the border since  the french side is under swiss jurisdiction and there is no obvious border within the site apart from a line of marker stones the sps and leplhc tunnels are almost entirely outside the main site and are mostly buried under french farmland and invisible from the surface they have surface sites at points around them either as the location of buildings associated with experiments or other facilities needed to operate the colliders such as cryogenic plants and access shafts the experiments are located at the same underground level as the tunnels at these sites three of these experimental sites are in france with atlas in switzerland and some of the ancillary cryogenic and access sites are in switzerland the largest of the experimental sites is the prevessin site also known as the north area which is the target station for noncollider experiments on the sps accelerator other sites are the ones which were used for the ua ua and the lep experiments the latter are used by lhc experiments outside of the lep and lhc experiments most are officially named and numbered after the site where they were located for example na was an experiment looking at the production of socalled charmed particles and located at the prevessin north area site wa used the big european bubble chamber bebc at the meyrin west area site to examine neutrino interactions the ua and ua experiments were considered to be in the underground area ie situated underground at sites on the sps accelerator most of the roads on the cern meyrin and prevessin sites are named after famous physicists such as niels bohr who pushed for cerns creation other notable names are richard feynman albert einstein and wolfgang pauli participation and funding member states and budget since its foundation by  members in  cern regularly

science the open science movement focuses on making scientific research openly accessible and on creating knowledge through open tools and processes open access open data open source software and hardware open licenses digital preservation and reproducible research are primary components of open science and areas in which cern has been working towards since its formation cern has developed policies and official documents that enable and promote open science starting with cerns founding convention in  which indicated that all its results are to be published or made generally available since then cern published its open access policy in  which ensures that all publications by cern authors will be published with gold open access and most recently an open data policy that was endorsed by the four main lhc collaborations alice atlas cms and lhcb the open data policy complements the open access policy addressing the public release of scientific data collected by lhc experiments after a suitable embargo period prior to this open data policy guidelines for data preservation access and reuse were implemented by each collaboration individually through their own policies which are updated when necessary the european strategy for particle physics a document mandated by the cern council that forms the cornerstone of europes decisionmaking for the future of particle physics was last updated in  and affirmed the organisations role within the open science landscape by stating the particle physics community should work with the relevant authorities to help shape the emerging consensus on open science to be adopted for publiclyfunded research and should then implement a policy of open science for the field beyond the policy level cern has established a variety of services and tools to enable and guide open science at cern and in particle physics more generally on the publishing side cern has initiated and operates a global cooperative project the sponsoring consortium for open access publishing in particle physics scoap to convert scientific articles in highenergy physics to open access in  the scoap partnership represented  libraries from  countries and  intergovernmental organizations who have worked collectively to convert research articles in highenergy physics across  leading journals in the discipline to open access publicfacing results can be served by various cernbased services depending on their use case the cern open data portal zenodo the cern document server inspire and hepdata are the core services used by the researchers and community at cern as well as the wider highenergy physics community for the publication of their documents data software multimedia etc cerns efforts towards preservation and reproducible research are best represented by a suite of services addressing the entire physics analysis lifecycle such as data software and computing environment cern analysis preservation helps researchers to preserve and document the various components of their physics analyses reana reusable analyses enables the instantiating of preserved research data analyses on the cloud all services are built using open source software and strive towards compliance with best effort principles such as the fair principles the force guidelines and plan s while taking into account relevant activities carried out by the european commission public exhibitions the first public exhibition at cern was the microcosm museum which hosted an exhibition about particle physics and cern history it closed permanently on  september  in preparation for the installation of the exhibitions in the newly built science center cern science gateway the cern science gateway constructed by the renzo piano building workshop was opened in

cern also provides daily tours to certain facilities such as the synchrocyclotron cerns first particle accelerator and the superconducting magnet workshop arts at cern cern launched its cultural policy for engaging with the arts in  the initiative provided the essential framework and foundations for establishing arts at cern the arts programme of the laboratory since  arts at cern has fostered creative dialogue between art and physics through residencies art commissions exhibitions and events artists across all creative disciplines have been invited to cern to experience how fundamental science pursues the big questions about our universe even before the arts programme officially started several highly regarded artists visited the laboratory drawn to physics and fundamental science in  james lee byars was the first artist to visit the laboratory and the only one so far to feature on the cover of the cern courier mariko mori gianni motti cerith wyn evans john berger and anselm kiefer are among the artists who came to cern in the years that followed the programmes of arts at cern are structured according to their values and vision to create bridges between cultures each programme is designed and formed in collaboration with cultural institutions other partner laboratories countries cities and artistic communities eager to connect with cerns research support their activities and contribute to a global network of art and science they comprise researchled artistic residencies that take place onsite or remotely more than  artists from  countries have participated in the residencies to expand their creative practices at the laboratory benefiting from the involvement of  physicists engineers and cern staff between  and  applications are received every year the programmes comprise collide the international residency programme organised in partnership with a city connect a programme of residencies to foster experimentation in art and science at
