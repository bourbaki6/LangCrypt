byzantium  or byzantion ancient greek  was an ancient greek city in classical antiquity that became known as constantinople in late antiquity and istanbul in modern times the greek name byzantion and its latinization byzantium continued to be used as a name of constantinople sporadically and to varying degrees during the thousandyear existence of the eastern roman empire which also became known by the former name of the city as the byzantine empire byzantium was colonized by greeks from megara in the th century bce and remained primarily greekspeaking until its conquest by the ottoman empire in  ce etymology the etymology of byzantium is unknown it has been suggested that the name is of thracian origin it may be derived from the thracian personal name byzas which means hegoat ancient greek legend refers to the greek king byzas the leader of the megarian colonists and founder oikistes of the city the name lygos for the city which likely corresponds to an earlier thracian settlement is mentioned by pliny the elder in his natural history byzantios plural byzantioi ancient greek   latin byzantius adjective the same referred to byzantions inhabitants also used as an ethnonym for the people of the city and as a family name in the middle ages byzantion was also a synecdoche for the eastern roman empire an ellipsis of medieval greek   romanized byzantion kratos byzantinos medieval greek  latin byzantinus denoted an inhabitant of the empire the anglicization of latin byzantinus yielded byzantine with th and th century forms including byzantin bizantine bezantine and bysantin as well as byzantian and bizantian the name byzantius and byzantinus were applied from the th century to gold byzantine coinage reflected in the french besant dor italian bisante and english besant byzant or bezant the english usage derived from old french besan pl besanz and relating to the coin dates from the th century later the name byzantium became common in the west to refer to the eastern roman empire whose capital was constantinople as a term for the east roman state as a whole byzantium was introduced by the historian hieronymus wolf only in  a century after the last remnants of the empire whose inhabitants continued to refer to their polity as the roman empire medieval greek    romanized basileia ton rhomaion lit empire of the romans had ceased to exist other places were historically known as byzantion   a city in libya mentioned by stephanus of byzantium and another on the western coast of india referred to by the periplus of the erythraean sea in both cases the names were probably adaptations of names in local languages faustus of byzantium was from a city of that name in cilicia history the origins of byzantium are shrouded in legend tradition says that byzas of megara a citystate near athens founded the city when he sailed northeast across the aegean sea the date is usually given as  bce on the authority of herodotus who states the city was founded  years after chalcedon eusebius who wrote almost  years later dates the founding of chalcedon to  bce but he also dates the founding of byzantium to  bce or a few years earlier depending on the edition herodotus dating was later favored by constantine the great who celebrated byzantiums th anniversary between the years  and  byzantium was mainly a trading city due to its location at the black seas only entrance byzantium later conquered chalcedon across the bosphorus on the asiatic side the city was taken by the persian empire at the time of the scythian campaign  bce of emperor darius i r  bce and was added to the administrative province of skudra though achaemenid control of the city was never as stable as compared to other cities in thrace it was considered alongside sestos to be one of the foremost achaemenid ports on the european coast of the bosphorus and the hellespont byzantium was besieged by greek forces during the peloponnesian war as part of spartas strategy for cutting off grain supplies to athens during their siege of athens sparta took control of the city in  bce to bring the athenians into submission the athenian military later retook the city in  bce when the spartans had withdrawn following their settlement after siding with pescennius niger against the victorious septimius severus the city was besieged by roman forces and suffered extensive damage in ce  byzantium was rebuilt by septimius severus now emperor and quickly regained its previous prosperity it was bound to perinthus during the period of septimius severus after the war byzantium lost its city status and free city privileges but caracalla persuaded severus to restore these rights in appreciation the byzantines named caracalla an archon of their city the strategic and highly defensible due to being surrounded by water on almost all sides location of byzantium attracted roman emperor constantine i who in ce  refounded it as an imperial residence inspired by rome itself known as nova roma later the city was called constantinople greek  konstantinoupolis city of constantine this combination of imperialism and location would affect constantinoples role as the nexus between the continents of europe and asia it was a commercial cultural and diplomatic centre and for centuries formed the capital of the byzantine empire which decorated the city with numerous monuments some still standing today with its strategic position constantinople controlled the major trade routes between asia and europe as well as the passage from the mediterranean sea to the black sea on may   the city was conquered by the ottoman turks and again became the capital of a powerful state the ottoman empire the turks called the city istanbul although it was not officially renamed until  the name derives from the greek phrase   which means to the city to this day it remains the largest and most populous city in turkey although ankara is now the national capital emblem by the late hellenistic or early roman period st century bc the star and crescent motif was associated to some degree with byzantium even though it became more widely used as the royal emblem of mithradates vi eupator who for a time incorporated the city into his empire some byzantine coins of the st century bc and later show the head of artemis with bow and quiver and feature a crescent with what appears to be an eightrayed star on the reverse according to accounts which vary in some of the details in  bc the byzantines and their allies the athenians were under siege by the troops of philip of macedon on a particularly dark and wet night philip attempted a surprise attack but was thwarted by the appearance of a bright light in the sky this light is occasionally described by subsequent interpreters as a meteor sometimes as the moon and some accounts also mention the barking of dogs however the original accounts mention only a bright light in the sky without specifying the moon to commemorate the event the byzantines erected a statue of hecate lampadephoros lightbearer or bringer this story survived in the works of hesychius of miletus who in all probability lived in the time of justinian i his works survive only in fragments preserved in photius and the tenth century lexicographer suidas the tale is also related by stephanus of byzantium and eustathius devotion to hecate was especially favored by the byzantines for her aid in having protected them from the incursions of philip of macedon her symbols were the crescent and star and the walls of her city were her provenance this contradicts claims that only the symbol of the crescent was meant to symbolize hecate whereas the star was only added later in order to symbolize the virgin mary as constantine i is said to have rededicated the city to her in the year  it is unclear precisely how the symbol hecateartemis one of many goddesses would have been transferred to the city itself but it seems likely to have been an effect of being credited with the intervention against philip and the subsequent honors this was a common process in ancient greece as in athens where the city was named after athena in honor of such an intervention in time of war cities in the roman empire often continued to issue their own coinage of the many themes that were used on local coinage celestial and astral symbols often appeared mostly stars or crescent moons the wide variety of these issues and the varying explanations for the significance of the star and crescent on roman coinage precludes their discussion here it is however apparent that by the time of the romans coins featuring a star or crescent in some combination were not at all rare people homerus tragedian lived in the early rd century bc philo engineer
