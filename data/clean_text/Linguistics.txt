linguistics is the scientific study of language the areas of linguistic analysis are syntax rules governing the structure of sentences semantics meaning morphology structure of words phonetics speech sounds and equivalent gestures in sign languages phonology the abstract sound system of a particular language and analogous systems of sign languages and pragmatics how the context of use contributes to meaning subdisciplines such as biolinguistics the study of the biological variables and evolution of language and psycholinguistics the study of psychological factors in human language bridge many of these divisions linguistics encompasses many branches and subfields that span both theoretical and practical applications theoretical linguistics is concerned with understanding the universal and fundamental nature of language and developing a general theoretical framework for describing it applied linguistics seeks to utilize the scientific findings of the study of language for practical purposes such as developing methods of improving language education and literacy mathematical linguistics is the application of mathematics to model phenomena and solve problems in general linguistics and theoretical linguistics computational linguistics is an interdisciplinary field concerned with the computational modelling of natural language as well as the study of appropriate computational approaches to linguistic questions linguistic features may be studied through a variety of perspectives synchronically by describing the structure of a language at a specific point in time or diachronically through the historical development of a language over a period of time in monolinguals or in multilinguals among children or among adults in terms of how it is being learnt or how it was acquired as abstract objects or as cognitive structures through written texts or through oral elicitation and finally through mechanical data collection or practical fieldwork linguistics emerged from the field of philology of which some branches are more qualitative and holistic in approach today philology and linguistics are variably described as related fields subdisciplines or separate fields of language study but by and large linguistics can be seen as an umbrella term linguistics is also related to the philosophy of language stylistics rhetoric semiotics lexicography and translation major subdisciplines historical linguistics historical linguistics is the study of how language changes over history particularly with regard to a specific language or a group of languages western trends in historical linguistics date back to roughly the late th century when the discipline grew out of philology the study of ancient texts and oral traditions historical linguistics emerged as one of the first few subdisciplines in the field and was most widely practised during the late th century despite a shift in focus in the th century towards formalism and generative grammar which studies the universal properties of language historical research today still remains a significant field of linguistic inquiry subfields of the discipline include language change and grammaticalization historical linguistics studies language change either diachronically through a comparison of different time periods in the past and present or in a synchronic manner by observing developments between different variations that exist within the current linguistic stage of a language at first historical linguistics was the cornerstone of comparative linguistics which involves a study of the relationship between different languages at that time scholars of historical linguistics were only concerned with creating different categories of language families and reconstructing prehistoric protolanguages by using both the comparative method and the method of internal reconstruction internal reconstruction is the method by which an element that contains a certain meaning is reused in different contexts or environments where there is a variation in either sound or analogy the reason for this had been to describe wellknown indoeuropean languages many of which had detailed documentation and long written histories scholars of historical linguistics also studied uralic languages another european language family for which very little written material existed back then after that there also followed significant work on the corpora of other languages such as the austronesian languages and the native american language families in historical work the uniformitarian principle is generally the underlying working hypothesis occasionally also clearly expressed the principle was expressed early by william dwight whitney who considered it imperative a must of historical linguistics to look to find the same principle operative also in the very outset of that language history the above approach of comparativism in linguistics is now however only a small part of the much broader discipline called historical linguistics the comparative study of specific indoeuropean languages is considered a highly specialized field today while comparative research is carried out over the subsequent internal developments in a language in particular over the development of modern standard varieties of languages and over the development of a language from its standardized form to its varieties for instance some scholars also tried to establish superfamilies linking for example indoeuropean uralic and other language families to a hypothetical nostratic language group while these attempts are still not widely accepted as credible methods they provide necessary information to establish relatedness in language change this is generally hard to find for events long ago due to the occurrence of chance word resemblances and variations between language groups a limit of around  years is often assumed for the functional purpose of conducting research it is also hard to date various protolanguages even though several methods are available these languages can be dated only approximately in modern historical linguistics we examine how languages change over time focusing on the relationships between dialects within a specific period this includes studying morphological syntactical and phonetic shifts connections between dialects in the past and present are also explored syntax syntax is the study of how words and morphemes combine to form larger units such as phrases and sentences central concerns of syntax include word order grammatical relations constituency agreement the nature of crosslinguistic variation and the relationship between form and meaning there are numerous approaches to syntax that differ in their central assumptions and goals morphology morphology is the study of words including the principles by which they are formed and how they relate to one another within a language most approaches to morphology investigate the structure of words in terms of morphemes which are the smallest units in a language with some independent meaning morphemes include roots that can exist as words by themselves but also categories such as affixes that can only appear as part of a larger word for example in english the root catch and the suffix ing are both morphemes catch may appear as its own word or it may be combined with ing to form the new word catching morphology also analyzes how words behave as parts of speech and how they may be inflected to express grammatical categories including number tense and aspect concepts such as productivity are concerned with how speakers create words in specific contexts which evolves over the history of a language the discipline that deals specifically with the sound changes occurring within morphemes is morphophonology semantics and pragmatics semantics and pragmatics are branches of linguistics concerned with meaning these subfields have traditionally been divided according to aspects of meaning semantics refers to grammatical and lexical meanings while pragmatics is concerned with meaning in context within linguistics the subfield of formal semantics studies the denotations of sentences and how they are composed from the meanings of their constituent expressions formal semantics draws heavily on philosophy of language and uses formal tools from logic and computer science on the other hand cognitive semantics explains linguistic meaning via aspects of general cognition drawing on ideas from cognitive science such as prototype theory pragmatics focuses on phenomena such as speech acts implicature and talk in interaction unlike semantics which examines meaning that is conventional or coded in a given language pragmatics studies how the transmission of meaning depends not only on the structural and linguistic knowledge grammar lexicon etc of the speaker and listener but also on the context of the utterance any preexisting knowledge about those involved the inferred intent of the speaker and other factors phonetics and phonology phonetics and phonology are branches of linguistics concerned with sounds or the equivalent aspects of sign languages phonetics is largely concerned with the physical aspects of sounds such as their articulation acoustics production and perception phonology is concerned with the linguistic abstractions and categorizations of sounds and it tells us what sounds are in a language how they do and can combine into words and explains why certain phonetic features are important to identifying a word typology structures linguistic structures are pairings of meaning and form any particular pairing of meaning and form is a saussurean linguistic sign for instance the meaning cat is represented worldwide with a wide variety of different sound patterns in oral languages movements of the hands and face in sign languages and written symbols in written languages linguistic patterns have proven their importance for the knowledge engineering field especially with the everincreasing amount of available data linguists focusing on structure attempt to understand the rules regarding language use that native speakers know not always consciously all linguistic structures can be broken down into component parts that are combined according to subconscious rules over multiple levels of analysis for instance consider the structure of the word tenth on two different levels of analysis on the level of internal word structure known as morphology the word tenth is made up of one linguistic form indicating a number and another form indicating ordinality the rule governing the combination of these forms ensures that the ordinality marker th follows the number ten on the level of sound structure known as phonology structural analysis shows that the n sound in tenth is made differently from the n sound in ten spoken alone although most speakers of english are consciously aware of the rules governing internal structure of the word pieces of tenth they are less often aware of the rule governing its sound structure linguists focused on structure find and analyze rules such as these which govern how native speakers use language grammar grammar is a system of rules which governs the production and use of utterances in a given language these rules apply to sound as well as meaning and include componential subsets of rules such as those pertaining to phonology the organization of phonetic sound systems morphology the formation and composition of words and syntax the formation and composition of phrases and sentences modern frameworks that deal with the principles of grammar include structural and functional linguistics and generative linguistics subfields that focus on a grammatical study of language include the following phonetics the study of the physical properties of speech sound production and perception and delves into their acoustic and articulatory properties phonology the study of sounds as abstract elements in the speakers mind that distinguish meaning phonemes morphology the study of morphemes or the internal structures of words and how they can be modified syntax the study of how words combine to form grammatical phrases and sentences semantics the study of lexical and grammatical aspects of meaning pragmatics the study of how utterances are used in communicative acts and the role played by situational context and nonlinguistic knowledge in the transmission of meaning discourse analysis the analysis of language use in texts spoken written or signed stylistics the study of linguistic factors rhetoric diction stress that place a discourse in context semiotics the study of signs and sign processes semiosis indication designation likeness analogy metaphor symbolism signification and communication discourse discourse is language as social practice baynham  and is a multilayered concept as a social practice discourse embodies different ideologies through written and spoken texts discourse analysis can examine or expose these ideologies discourse not only influences genre which is selected based on specific contexts but also at a micro level shapes language as text spoken or written down to the phonological and lexicogrammatical levels grammar and discourse are linked as parts of a system a particular discourse becomes a language variety when it is used in this way for a particular purpose and is referred to as a register there may be certain lexical additions new words that are brought into play because of the expertise of the community of people within a certain domain of specialization thus registers and discourses distinguish themselves not only through specialized vocabulary but also in some cases through distinct stylistic choices people in the medical fraternity for example may use some medical terminology in their communication that is specialized to the field of medicine this is often referred to as being part of the medical discourse and so on lexicon the lexicon is a catalogue of words and terms that are stored in a speakers mind the lexicon consists of words and bound morphemes which are parts of words that can not stand alone like affixes in some analyses compound words and certain classes of idiomatic expressions and other collocations are also considered to be part of the lexicon dictionaries represent attempts at listing in alphabetical order the lexicon of a given language usually however bound morphemes are not included lexicography closely linked with the domain of semantics is the science of mapping the words into an encyclopedia or a dictionary the creation and addition of new words into the lexicon is called coining or neologization and the new words are called neologisms it is often believed that a speakers capacity for language lies in the quantity of words stored in the lexicon however this is often considered a myth by linguists the capacity for the use of language is considered by many linguists to lie primarily in the domain of grammar and to be linked with competence rather than with the growth of vocabulary even a very small lexicon is theoretically capable of producing an infinite number of sentences vocabulary size is relevant as a measure of comprehension there is general consensus that reading comprehension of a written text in english requires  coverage meaning that the person understands  of the words in the text the question of how much vocabulary is needed is therefore related to which texts or conversations need to be understood a common estimate is  word families to understand a wide range of conversations and  word families to be able to read a wide range of written texts style stylistics also involves the study of written signed or spoken discourse through varying speech communities genres and editorial or narrative formats in the mass media it involves the study and interpretation of texts for aspects of their linguistic and tonal style stylistic analysis entails the analysis of description of particular dialects and registers used by speech communities stylistic features include rhetoric diction stress satire irony dialogue and other forms of phonetic variations stylistic analysis can also include the study of language in canonical works of literature popular fiction news advertisements and other forms of communication in popular culture as well it is usually seen as a variation in communication that changes from speaker to speaker and community to community in short stylistics is the interpretation of text in the s jacques derrida for instance further distinguished between speech and writing by proposing that written language be studied as a linguistic medium of communication in itself palaeography is therefore the discipline that studies the evolution of written scripts as signs and symbols in language the formal study of language also led to the growth of fields like psycholinguistics which explores the representation and function of language in the mind neurolinguistics which studies language processing in the brain biolinguistics which studies the biology and evolution of language and language acquisition which investigates how children and adults acquire the knowledge of one or more languages methodology modern linguistics is primarily descriptive linguists describe and explain features of language without making subjective judgments on whether a particular feature or usage is good or bad this is analogous to practice in other sciences a zoologist studies the animal kingdom without making subjective judgments on whether a particular species is better or worse than another prescription on the other hand is an attempt to promote particular linguistic usages over others often favoring a particular dialect or acrolect this may have the aim of establishing a linguistic standard which can aid communication over large geographical areas it may also however be an attempt by speakers of one language or dialect to exert influence over speakers of other languages or dialects see linguistic imperialism an extreme version of prescriptivism can be found among censors who attempt to eradicate words and structures that they consider to be destructive to society prescription however may be practised appropriately in language instruction like in elt where certain fundamental grammatical rules and lexical items need to be introduced to a secondlanguage speaker who is attempting to acquire the language sources most contemporary linguists work under the assumption that spoken data and signed data are more fundamental than written data this is because speech appears to be universal to all human beings capable of producing and perceiving it while there have been many cultures and speech communities that lack written communication features appear in speech which are not always recorded in writing including phonological rules sound changes and speech errors all natural writing systems reflect a spoken language or potentially a signed one even with pictographic scripts like dongba writing naxi homophones with the same pictogram and text in writing systems used for two languages changing to fit the spoken language being recorded speech evolved before human beings invented writing individuals learn to speak and process spoken language more easily and earlier than they do with writing nonetheless linguists agree that the study of written language can be worthwhile and valuable for research that relies on corpus linguistics and computational linguistics written language is often much more convenient for processing large amounts of linguistic data large corpora of spoken language are difficult to create and hard to find and are typically transcribed and written in addition linguists have turned to textbased discourse occurring in various formats of computermediated communication as a viable site for linguistic inquiry the study of writing systems themselves graphemics is in any case considered a branch of linguistics analysis before the th century linguists analysed language on a diachronic plane which was historical in focus this meant that they would compare linguistic features and try to analyse language from the point of view of how it had changed between then and later however with the rise of saussurean linguistics in the th century the focus shifted to a more synchronic approach where the study was geared towards analysis and comparison between different language variations which existed at the same given point of time at another level the syntagmatic plane of linguistic analysis entails the comparison between the way words are sequenced within the syntax of a sentence for example the article the is followed by a noun because of the syntagmatic relation between the words the paradigmatic plane on the other hand focuses on an analysis that is based on the paradigms or concepts that are embedded in a given text in this case words of the same type or class may be replaced in the text with each other to achieve the same conceptual understanding history the earliest activities in the description of language have been attributed to the thcentury bc indian grammarian panini who composed a formal description of the sanskrit language in his astadhyayi today modernday theories on grammar employ many of the principles that were laid down then nomenclature before the th century the term philology first attested in  was commonly used to refer to the study of language which was then predominantly historical in focus since ferdinand de saussures insistence on the importance of synchronic analysis however this focus has shifted and the term philology is now generally used for the study of a languages grammar history and literary tradition especially in the united states where philology has never been very popularly considered as the science of language although the term linguist in the sense of a student of language dates from  the term linguistics is first attested in  it is now the usual term in english for the scientific study of language though linguistic science is sometimes used linguistics is a multidisciplinary field of research that combines tools from natural sciences social sciences formal sciences and the humanities many linguists such as david crystal conceptualize the field as being primarily scientific the term linguist applies to someone who studies language or is a researcher within the field or to someone who uses the tools of the discipline to describe and analyse specific languages early grammarians an early formal study of language was undertaken in india by the thcentury bc grammarian panini who formulated  rules of sanskrit morphology paninis systematic classification of the sounds of sanskrit into consonants and vowels and word classes such as nouns and verbs was the first known instance of its kind in the middle east sibawayh a persian made a detailed description of arabic in ad  in his monumental work alkitab fii annaw    the book on grammar the first known author to distinguish between sounds and phonemes sounds as units of a linguistic system western interest in the study of languages began somewhat later than in the east but the grammarians of the classical languages did not use the same methods or reach the same conclusions as their contemporaries in the indic world early interest in language in the west was a part of philosophy not of grammatical description the first insights into semantic theory were made by plato in his cratylus dialogue where he argues that words denote concepts that are eternal and exist in the world of ideas this work is the first to use the word etymology to describe the history of a words meaning around  bc one of alexander the greats successors founded a university see musaeum in alexandria where a school of philologists studied the ancient texts in greek and taught greek to speakers of other languages while this school was the first to use the word grammar in its modern sense plato had used the word in its original meaning as techne grammatike   the art of writing which is also the title of one of the most important works of the alexandrine school by dionysius thrax throughout the middle ages the study of language was subsumed under the topic of philology the study of ancient languages and texts practised by such educators as roger ascham wolfgang ratke and john amos comenius comparative philology in the th century the first use of the comparative method by william jones sparked the rise of comparative linguistics bloomfield attributes the first great scientific linguistic work of the world to jacob grimm who wrote deutsche grammatik it was soon followed by other authors writing similar comparative studies on other language groups of europe the study of language was broadened from indoeuropean to language in general by wilhelm von humboldt of whom bloomfield asserts this study received its foundation at the hands of the prussian statesman and scholar wilhelm von humboldt  especially in the first volume of his work on kavi the literary language of java entitled uber die verschiedenheit des menschlichen sprachbaues und ihren einflu auf die geistige entwickelung des menschengeschlechts on the variety of the structure of human language and its influence upon the mental development of the human race thcentury developments there was a shift of focus from historical and comparative linguistics to synchronic analysis in early th century structural analysis was improved by leonard bloomfield louis hjelmslev and zellig harris who also developed methods of discourse analysis functional analysis was developed by the prague linguistic circle and andre martinet as sound recording devices became commonplace in the s dialectal recordings were made and archived and the audiolingual method provided a technological solution to foreign language learning the s also saw a new rise of comparative linguistics the study of language universals in linguistic typology towards the end of the century the field of linguistics became divided into further areas of interest with the advent of language technology and digitalized corpora areas of research sociolinguistics sociolinguistics is the study of how language is shaped by social factors this subdiscipline focuses on the synchronic approach of linguistics and looks at how a language in general or a set of languages display variation and varieties at a given point in time the study of language variation and the different varieties of language through dialects registers and idiolects can be tackled through a study of style as well as through analysis of discourse sociolinguists research both style and discourse in language as well as the theoretical factors that are at play between language and society developmental linguistics developmental linguistics is the study of the development of linguistic ability in individuals particularly the acquisition of language in childhood some of the questions that developmental linguistics looks into are how children acquire different languages how adults can acquire a second language and what the process of language acquisition is neurolinguistics neurolinguistics is the study of the structures in the human brain that underlie grammar and communication researchers are drawn to the field from a variety of backgrounds bringing along a variety of experimental techniques as well as widely varying theoretical perspectives much work in neurolinguistics is informed by models in psycholinguistics and theoretical linguistics and is focused on investigating how the brain can implement the processes that theoretical and psycholinguistics propose are necessary in producing and comprehending language neurolinguists study the physiological mechanisms by which the brain processes information related to language and evaluate linguistic and psycholinguistic theories using aphasiology brain imaging electrophysiology and computer modelling amongst the structures of the brain involved in the mechanisms of neurolinguistics the cerebellum which contains the highest numbers of neurons has a major role in terms of predictions required to produce language applied linguistics linguists are largely concerned with finding and describing the generalities and varieties both within particular languages and among all languages applied linguistics takes the results of those findings and applies them to other areas linguistic research is commonly applied to areas such as language education lexicography translation language planning which involves governmental policy implementation related to language use and natural language processing applied linguistics has been argued to be something of a misnomer applied linguists actually focus on making sense of and engineering solutions for realworld linguistic problems and not literally applying existing technical knowledge from linguistics moreover they commonly apply technical knowledge from multiple sources such as sociology eg conversation analysis and anthropology constructed language fits under applied linguistics today computers are widely used in many areas of applied linguistics speech synthesis and speech recognition use phonetic and phonemic knowledge to provide voice interfaces to computers applications of computational linguistics in machine translation computerassisted translation and natural language processing are areas of applied linguistics that have come to the forefront their influence has had an effect on theories of syntax and semantics as modelling syntactic and semantic theories on computers constraints linguistic analysis is a subdiscipline of applied linguistics used by many governments to verify the claimed nationality of people seeking asylum who do not hold the necessary documentation to prove their claim this often takes the form of an interview by personnel in an immigration department depending on the country this interview is conducted either in the asylum seekers native language through an interpreter or in an international lingua franca like english australia uses the former method while germany employs the latter the netherlands uses either method depending on the languages involved tape recordings of the interview then undergo language analysis which can be done either by private contractors or within a department of the government in this analysis linguistic features of the asylum seeker are used by analysts to make a determination about the speakers nationality the reported findings of the linguistic analysis can play a critical role in the governments decision on the refugee status of the asylum seeker language documentation language documentation combines anthropological inquiry into the history and culture of language with linguistic inquiry in order to describe languages and their grammars lexicography involves the documentation of words that form a vocabulary such a documentation of a linguistic vocabulary from a particular language is usually compiled in a dictionary computational linguistics is concerned with the statistical or rulebased modeling of natural language from a computational perspective specific knowledge of language is applied by speakers during the act of translation and interpretation as well as in language education  the teaching of a second or foreign language policy makers work with governments to implement new plans in education and teaching which are based on linguistic research since the inception of the discipline of linguistics linguists have been concerned with describing and analysing previously undocumented languages starting with franz boas in the early s this became the main focus of american linguistics until the rise of formal linguistics in the midth century this focus on language documentation was partly motivated by a concern to document the rapidly disappearing languages of indigenous peoples the ethnographic dimension of the boasian approach to language description played a role in the development of disciplines such as sociolinguistics anthropological linguistics and linguistic anthropology which investigate the relations between language culture and society the emphasis on linguistic description and documentation has also gained prominence outside north america with the documentation of rapidly dying indigenous languages becoming a focus in some university programs in linguistics language description is a workintensive endeavour usually requiring years of field work in the language concerned so as to equip the linguist to write a sufficiently accurate reference grammar further the task of documentation requires the linguist to collect a substantial corpus in the language in question consisting of texts and recordings both sound and video which can be stored in an accessible format within open repositories and used for further research translation the subfield of translation includes the translation of written and spoken texts across media from digital to print and spoken to translate literally means to transmute the meaning from one language into another translators are often employed by organizations such as travel agencies and governmental embassies to facilitate communication between two speakers who do not know each others language translators are also employed to work within computational linguistics setups like google translate which is an automated program to translate words and phrases between any two or more given languages translation is also conducted by publishing houses which convert works of writing from one language to another in order to reach varied audiences crossnational and crosscultural survey research studies employ translation to collect comparable data among multilingual populations academic translators specialize in or are familiar with various other disciplines such as technology science law economics etc

computational consideration of algorithmic specification and computational complexity so that the linguistic theories devised can be shown to exhibit certain desirable computational properties and their implementations computational linguists also work on computer language and software development evolutionary linguistics evolutionary linguistics is a sociobiological approach to analyzing the emergence of the language faculty through human evolution and also the application of evolutionary theory to the study of cultural evolution among different languages it is also a study of the
