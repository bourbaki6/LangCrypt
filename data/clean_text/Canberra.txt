a man british exploration and colonisation in october  charles throsby smith led the first british expedition to the area four other expeditions occurred between  and  with the first accurate map being produced by explorer mark john currie in june  by this stage the area had become known as the limestone plains british settlement of the area probably dates from late  when a sheep station was formed on what is now the acton peninsula by james cowan the head stockman employed by joshua john moore moore had received a land grant in the region in  and formally applied to purchase the site on  december  he named the property canberry on  april  moore was told by letter that he could retain possession of  acres  ha at canberry other colonists soon followed moores example to take up land in the region around  james ainslie working on behalf of the wealthy merchant robert campbell arrived to establish a sheep station he was guided to the region by a local aboriginal girl who showed him the fine lands of her pialligo clan the area then became the property of campbell and it was initially named pialligo before campbell changed it to the scottish title of duntroon campbell and his family built a dairy on the site in  now regarded as the oldest standing european building in canberra followed by the imposing stone house that is now the officers mess of the royal military college duntroon the campbells sponsored settlement by other farmer families to work their land such as the southwells of weetangera other notable early colonists included henry donnison who established the yarralumla estatenow the site of the official residence of the governorgeneral of australiain  and john palmer who employed duncan macfarlane to form the jerrabomberra property in  a year later john macpherson established the springbank estate becoming the first british owneroccupier in the region the anglican church of st john the baptist in the suburb of reid was consecrated in  and is now the oldest surviving public building in the city st johns churchyard contains the earliest graves in the district it has been described as a sanctuary in the city remaining a small english villagestyle church even as the capital grew around it canberras first school st johns school now a museum was situated next to the church and opened in the same year of  it was built to educate local settlers children including the blundell children who lived in nearby blundells cottage as the european presence increased the indigenous population dwindled largely due to the destruction of their society dislocation from their lands and from introduced diseases such as influenza smallpox alcoholism and measles creation of the nations capital the districts change from a rural area in new south wales to the national capital started during debates over federation in the late th century following a long dispute over whether sydney or melbourne should be the national capital a compromise was reached the new capital would be built in new south wales so long as it was at least  mi  km from sydney with melbourne to be the temporary seat of government while the new capital was built a survey was conducted across several sites in new south wales with bombala southern monaro orange yass albury tamworth armidale tumut and dalgety all discussed dalgety was chosen by the federal parliament and it passed the seat of government act  confirming dalgety as the site of the nations capital however the new south wales government refused to cede the required territory as they did not accept the site in  the new south wales government finally agreed to cede sufficient land provided that it was in the yasscanberra region as this site was closer to sydney newspaper proprietor john gale circulated a pamphlet titled dalgety or canberra which advocating canberra to every member of the commonwealths seven state and federal parliaments by many accounts it was decisive in the selection of canberra as the site in  as was a result of survey work done by the government surveyor charles scrivener the nsw government ceded the district to the federal government in  and the federal capital territory was established an international design competition was launched by the department of home affairs on  april  closing on  january  the competition was boycotted by the royal institute of british architects the institution of civil engineers and their affiliated bodies throughout the british empire because the minister for home affairs king omalley insisted that the final decision was for him to make rather than an expert in city planning a total of  valid entries were received omalley appointed a threemember board to advise him but they could not reach unanimity on  may  omalley came down on the side of the majority of the board with the design by walter burley griffin and marion mahony griffin of chicago illinois united states being declared the winner second was eliel saarinen of finland and third was alfred agache of brazil but resident in paris france omalley then appointed a sixmember board to advise him on the implementation of the winning design on  november  the board advised that it could not support the griffins plan in its entirety and suggested an alternative plan of its own devising this plan ostensibly incorporated the best features of the three placegetting designs as well as of a fourth design by h caswell rcg coulter and w scottgriffiths of sydney the rights to which it had purchased it was this composite plan that was endorsed by parliament and given formal approval by omalley on  january  however it was the griffin plan which was ultimately proceeded with in  walter burley griffin was appointed federal capital director of design and construction and construction began on  february king omalley drove the first peg in the construction of the future capital city in  the government invited suggestions from the public as to the name of the future city almost  names were suggested at midday on  march  lady denman the wife of governorgeneral lord denman announced that the city would be named canberra at a ceremony at kurrajong hill which has since become capital hill and the site of the present parliament house canberra day is a public holiday observed in the act on the second monday in march to celebrate the founding of canberra after the ceremony bureaucratic disputes hindered griffins work a royal commission in  ruled his authority had been usurped by certain officials and his original plan was reinstated griffins relationship with the australian authorities was strained and a lack of funding meant that by the time he was fired in  little work had been done by this time griffin had revised his plan overseen the earthworks of major avenues and established the glenloch cork plantation development throughout th century the commonwealth government purchased the pastoral property of yarralumla in  to provide an official residence for the governorgeneral of australia in the new capital renovations began in  to enlarge and modernise the property in  the property was officially dubbed government house on  may that year the commonwealth parliament moved to canberra with the opening of the provisional parliament house the prime minister stanley bruce had officially taken up residence in the lodge a few days earlier planned development of the city slowed significantly during the depression of the s and during world war ii some projects planned for that time including roman catholic and anglican cathedrals were never completed nevertheless in  the roman catholic parish church of st christopher was remodelled into st christophers cathedral manuka serving the archdiocese of canberra and goulburn it is the only cathedral in canberra from  to  three bodies  successively the federal capital advisory committee the federal capital commission and the national capital planning and development committee  continued to plan the further expansion of canberra in the absence of griffin however they were only advisory and development decisions were made without consulting them which increased inefficiency the largest event in canberra up to world war ii was the th meeting of anzaas in january  the canberra times described it as a signal event  in the history of this the worlds youngest capital city the citys accommodation was not nearly sufficient to house the  delegates and a tent city had to be set up on the banks of the molonglo river one of the prominent speakers was h g wells who was a guest of the governorgeneral lord gowrie for a week this event coincided with a heatwave across southeastern australia during which the temperature in canberra reached  degrees fahrenheit  celsius on  january on friday  january the black friday bushfires caused  deaths in victoria and wells accompanied the governorgeneral on his tour of areas threatened by fires immediately after the end of the war canberra was criticised for resembling a village and its disorganised collection of buildings was deemed ugly canberra was often derisively described as several suburbs in search of a city prime minister sir robert menzies regarded the state of the national capital as an embarrassment over time his attitude changed from one of contempt to that of championing its development he fired two ministers charged with the development of the city for poor performance menzies remained in office for over a decade and in that time the development of the capital sped up rapidly the population grew by more than  per cent in every fiveyear period from  to  several government departments together with public servants were moved to canberra from melbourne following the war government housing projects were undertaken to accommodate the citys growing population the national capital development commission ncdc formed in  with executive powers and ended four decades of disputes over the shape and design of lake burley griffin  the centrepiece of griffins design  and construction was completed in  after four years of work the completion of the lake finally laid the platform for the development of griffins parliamentary triangle since the initial construction of the lake various buildings of national importance have been constructed on its shores the newly built australian national university was expanded and sculptures as well as monuments were built a new national library was constructed within the parliamentary triangle followed by the high court and the national gallery suburbs in canberra central often referred to as north canberra and south canberra were further developed in the s and urban development in the districts of woden valley and belconnen commenced in the mid and late s respectively followed by the district of tuggeranong in the mids many of the new suburbs were named after australian politicians such as barton deakin reid braddon curtin chifley and parkes on  may  a larger and permanent parliament house was opened on capital hill as part of australias bicentenary celebrations the commonwealth parliament moved there from the provisional parliament house now known as old parliament house selfgovernment in december  the australian capital territory was granted full selfgovernment by the commonwealth parliament a step proposed as early as  following the first election on  march  a member legislative assembly sat at temporary offices at  constitution avenue civic on  may  permanent premises were opened on london circuit in  the australian labor party formed the acts first government led by the chief minister rosemary follett who made history as australias first female head of government the s also saw urban development begin in the district of gungahlin in the far north of the act parts of canberra were engulfed by bushfires on  january  that killed four people injured  and destroyed more than  homes as well as the major research telescopes of australian national universitys mount stromlo observatory throughout  several events celebrated the th anniversary of the naming of canberra on  march  the last day of the centennial year the canberra centenary column was unveiled in city hill other works included the skywhale a hot air balloon designed by the sculptor patricia piccinini and stellrscope by visual media artist eleanor gatesstuart on

are the skywhales in  canberra was named the best city to live in the world by the organisation for economic cooperation and development and was named the third best city to visit in the world by lonely planet in  geography canberra is located near the brindabella ranges part of the australian alps approximately  km  mi inland from australias east coast canberra is not incorporated but its urban environs which include a large part of the act east of the murrumbidgee river have an elevation of approximately  m  ft ahd the highest point near the built up area is mount majura at  m  ft other low mountains include mount taylor  m  ft mount ainslie  m  ft mount mugga mugga  m  ft and black mountain  m  ft the native forest in the canberra region was almost wholly eucalypt species and provided a resource for fuel and domestic purposes by the early s logging had depleted the eucalypt and concern about water quality led to the forests being closed interest in forestry began in  with trials of a number of species including pinus radiata on the slopes of mount stromlo since then plantations have been expanded with the benefit of reducing erosion in the cotter catchment and the forests are also popular recreation areas the urban environs of canberra straddle the ginninderra plain molonglo plain the limestone plain and the tuggeranong plain isabellas plain the molonglo river which flows across the molonglo plain has been dammed to form the national capitals iconic feature lake burley griffin the molonglo then flows into the murrumbidgee northwest of canberra which in turn flows northwest toward the new south wales town of yass the queanbeyan river joins the molonglo river at oaks estate just within the act a number of creeks including jerrabomberra and yarralumla creeks flow into the molonglo and murrumbidgee two of these creeks the ginninderra and tuggeranong have similarly been dammed to form lakes ginninderra and tuggeranong until recently the molonglo river had a history of sometimes calamitous floods the area was a flood plain prior to the filling of lake burley griffin climate under the koppengeiger classification canberra has an oceanic climate cfb in january the warmest month the average high is approximately  c  f in july the coldest month the average high drops to approximately  c  f frost is common in the winter months snow is rare in the cbd central business district due to being on the leeward eastern side of the dividing range but the surrounding areas get annual snowfall through winter and often the snowcapped brindabella range can be seen from the cbd the last significant snowfall in the city centre was in  the highest recorded maximum temperature was  c  f on  january  winter  was canberras warmest winter on record approximately  c  f above the average temperature the lowest recorded minimum temperature was  c  f on the morning of  july  light snow falls only once in every few years and is usually not widespread and quickly dissipates canberra is protected from the west by the brindabellas which create a strong rain shadow in canberras valleys canberra gets  clear days annually annual rainfall is the third lowest of the capital cities after adelaide and hobart and is spread fairly evenly over the seasons with late spring bringing the highest rainfall thunderstorms occur mostly between october and april owing to the effect of summer and the mountains the area is generally sheltered from a westerly wind though strong northwesterlies can develop a cool vigorous afternoon easterly change colloquially referred to as a seabreeze or the braidwood butcher is common during the summer months and often exceeds  kmh in the city canberra is also less humid than the nearby coastal areas canberra was severely affected by smoke haze during the  bushfires on  january  canberra had the worst air quality of any major city in the world with an aqi of  usaqi  urban structure unusual among australian cities canberra is an entirely planned city grounded in a design by american architects walter burley griffin and marion mahony griffin within the central area of the city near lake burley griffin major roads follow a wheelandspoke pattern rather than a grid griffins proposal had an abundance of geometric patterns including concentric hexagonal and octagonal streets emanating from several radii however the outer areas of the city built later are not laid out geometrically lake burley griffin was deliberately designed so that the orientation of the components was related to various topographical landmarks in canberra the lakes stretch from east to west and divided the city in two a land axis perpendicular to the central basin stretches from capital hillthe eventual location of the new parliament house on a mound on the southern sidenorth northeast across the central basin to the northern banks along anzac parade to the australian war memorial this was designed so that looking from capital hill the war memorial stood directly at the foot of mount ainslie at the southwestern end of the land axis was bimberi peak the highest mountain in the act approximately  km  mi south west of canberra the straight edge of the circular segment that formed the central basin of lake burley griffin was perpendicular to the land axis and designated the water axis and it extended northwest towards black mountain a line parallel to the water axis on the northern side of the city was designated the municipal axis the municipal axis became the location of constitution avenue which links city hill in civic centre and both market centre and the defence precinct on russell hill commonwealth avenue and kings avenue were to run from the southern side from capital hill to city hill and market centre on the north respectively and they formed the western and eastern edges of the central basin the area enclosed by the three avenues was known as the parliamentary triangle and formed the centrepiece of griffins work the griffins assigned spiritual values to mount ainslie black mountain and red hill and originally planned to cover each of these in flowers that way each hill would be covered with a single primary colour which represented its spiritual value this part of their plan never came to fruition as world war i slowed construction and planning disputes led to griffins dismissal by prime minister billy hughes after the war ended the urban areas of canberra are organised into a hierarchy of districts town centres group centres local suburbs as well as other industrial areas and villages there are seven residential districts each of which is divided into smaller suburbs and most of which have a town centre which is the focus of commercial and social activities the districts were settled in the following chronological order canberra central mostly settled in the s and s with expansion up to the s woden valley first settled in  belconnen first settled in  weston creek first settled in  tuggeranong first settled in  gungahlin first settled in  molonglo valley development began in  the canberra central district is substantially based on walter burley griffins designs in  the then national capital development commission adopted the y plan which laid out future urban development in canberra around a series of central shopping and commercial area known as the town centres linked by freeways the layout of which roughly resembled the shape of the letter y with tuggeranong at the base of the y and belconnen and gungahlin located at the ends of the arms of the y development in canberra has been closely regulated by government both through planning processes and the use of crown lease terms that have tightly limited the use of parcels of land land in the act is held on year crown leases from the national government although most leases are now administered by the territory government there have been persistent calls for constraints on development to be liberalised but also voices in support of planning consistent with the original bush capital and urban forest ideals that underpin canberras design many of canberras suburbs are named after former prime ministers famous australians early settlers or use aboriginal words for their title street names typically follow a particular theme for example the streets of duffy are named after australian dams and reservoirs the streets of dunlop are named after australian inventions inventors and artists and the streets of page are named after biologists and naturalists most diplomatic missions are located in the suburbs of yarralumla deakin and omalley there are three light industrial areas the suburbs of fyshwick mitchell and hume sustainability and the environment the average canberran was responsible for  tonnes of greenhouse gases in  in  the act government legislated greenhouse gas targets to reduce its emissions by  per cent from  levels by   per cent by  with no net emissions by  the government announced in  a target for  of electricity consumed in the act to be supplied from renewable sources by  and in  set an ambitious target of  by  canberra achieved  renewable electricity in  and the act government committed in  to canberra using  renewable energy in  in  canberra became the first city in the world to set a vision of no waste proposing an ambitious target of  for completion the strategy aimed to achieve a wastefree society by  through the combined efforts of industry government and community by early  it was apparent that though it had reduced waste going to landfill the act initiatives original  target for absolutely zero landfill waste would be delayed or revised to meet the reality plastic bags made of polyethylene polymer with a thickness of less than  m were banned from retail distribution in the act from november  the ban was introduced by the act government in an effort to make canberra more sustainable of all waste produced in the act  per cent is recycled average household food waste in the act remains above the australian average costing an average  per household per annum government and politics territory government there is no local council or city government for canberra which thus has no precise definition the australian capital territory legislative assembly administers both the urban area and the rest of the australian capital territory at the  census all but  people were calculated to reside in the urban area of canberra the assembly consists of  members elected from five districts using proportional representation the five districts are brindabella ginninderra kurrajong murrumbidgee and yerrabi which each elect five members the chief minister is elected by the members of the legislative assembly mla and selects colleagues to serve as ministers alongside him or her in the executive known informally as the cabinet whereas the act has federally been dominated by labor the liberals have been able to gain some footing in the act legislative assembly and were in government during a period of  years from  and  labor took back control of the assembly in  at the  election chief minister jon stanhope and the labor party won  of the  seats allowing them to form the acts first majority government since  the act has been governed by a coalition of labor and the greens as of  the chief minister was andrew barr from the australian labor party the australian federal government retains some influence over the act government in the administrative sphere most frequently this is through the actions of the national capital authority which is responsible for planning and development in areas of canberra which are considered to be of national importance or which are central to griffins plan for the city such as the parliamentary triangle lake burley griffin major approach and processional roads areas where the commonwealth retains ownership of the land or undeveloped hills and ridgelines which form part of the canberra nature park the national government also retains a level of control over the territory assembly through the provisions of the australian capital territory selfgovernment act  this federal act defines the legislative power of the act assembly federal representation the act was given its first federal parliamentary representation in  when it gained a seat in the house of representatives the division of australian capital territory however until  the act member could only vote on matters directly affecting the territory and did not count for purposes of forming government in  the act was allocated two senate seats and the house of representatives seat was divided into two a third was created in  but was abolished in  because of changes to the regional demographic distribution a third seat was recreated at a redistribution in  as the division of bean the house of representatives seats have mostly been held by labor and usually by comfortable margins the labor party has held all seats at every federal election since  although it lost a byelection for the division of canberra in  the alp and the liberal party held one senate seat each until the  election when independent candidate david pocock unseated the liberal candidate zed seselja judiciary and policing the australian federal police afp provides all of the constabulary services in the territory in a manner similar to state police forces under a contractual agreement with the act government through its community policing arm act policing people who have been charged with offences are tried either in the act magistrates court or for more severe offences the act supreme court since  prisoners including those on remand have been held at the alexander maconochie centre the act civil and administrative tribunal deal with minor civil law actions and other various legal matters canberra is often descibed as australias safest city as of  the most common crimes in the act were property related crimes unlawful entry with intent and motor vehicle theft they affected  and  people  and  per  persons respectively rates of sexual assault   per  persons are also below the national average  per  these rates are lower than the equivalent figures for other states and the northern territory except for motor vehicle theft economy in
