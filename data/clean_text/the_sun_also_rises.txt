robert cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of princeton do not think that i am very much impressed by that as a boxing title but it meant a lot to cohn he cared nothing for boxing in fact he disliked it but he learned it painfully and thoroughly to counteract the feeling of inferiority and shyness he had felt on being treated as a jew at princeton there was a certain inner comfort in knowing he could knock down anybody who was snooty to him although being very shy and a thoroughly nice boy he never fought except in the gym he was spider kellys star pupil spider kelly taught all his young gentlemen to box like featherweights no matter whether they weighed one hundred and five or two hundred and five pounds but it seemed to fit cohn he was really very fast he was so good that spider promptly overmatched him and got his nose permanently flattened this increased cohns distaste for boxing but it gave him a certain satisfaction of some strange sort and it certainly improved his nose in his last year at princeton he read too much and took to wearing spectacles i never met any one of his class who remembered him they did not even remember that he was middleweight boxing champion i mistrust all frank and simple people especially when their stories hold together and i always had a suspicion that perhaps robert cohn had never been middleweight boxing champion and that perhaps a horse had stepped on his face or that maybe his mother had been frightened or seen something or that he had maybe bumped into something as a young child but i finally had somebody verify the story from spider kelly spider kelly not only remembered cohn he had often wondered what had become of him robert cohn was a member through his father of one of the richest jewish families in new york and through his mother of one of the oldest at the military school where he prepped for princeton and played a very good end on the football team no one had made him raceconscious no one had ever made him feel he was a jew and hence any different from anybody else until he went to princeton he was a nice boy a friendly boy and very shy and it made him bitter he took it out in boxing and he came out of princeton with painful selfconsciousness and the flattened nose and was married by the first girl who was nice to him he was married five years had three children lost most of the fifty thousand dollars his father left him the balance of the estate having gone to his mother hardened into a rather unattractive mould under domestic unhappiness with a rich wife and just when he had made up his mind to leave his wife she left him and went off with a miniaturepainter as he had been thinking for months about leaving his wife and had not done it because it would be too cruel to deprive her of himself her departure was a very healthful shock the divorce was arranged and robert cohn went out to the coast in california he fell among literary people and as he still had a little of the fifty thousand left in a short time he was backing a review of the arts the review commenced publication in carmel california and finished in provincetown massachusetts by that time cohn who had been regarded purely as an angel and whose name had appeared on the editorial page merely as a member of the advisory board had become the sole editor it was his money and he discovered he liked the authority of editing he was sorry when the magazine became too expensive and he had to give it up by that time though he had other things to worry about he had been taken in hand by a lady who hoped to rise with the magazine she was very forceful and cohn never had a chance of not being taken in hand also he was sure that he loved her when this lady saw that the magazine was not going to rise she became a little disgusted with cohn and decided that she might as well get what there was to get while there was still something available so she urged that they go to europe where cohn could write they came to europe where the lady had been educated and stayed three years during these three years the first spent in travel the last two in paris robert cohn had two friends braddocks and myself braddocks was his literary friend i was his tennis friend the lady who had him her name was frances found toward the end of the second year that her looks were going and her attitude toward robert changed from one of careless possession and exploitation to the absolute determination that he should marry her during this time roberts mother had settled an allowance on him about three hundred dollars a month during two years and a half i do not believe that robert cohn looked at another woman he was fairly happy except that like many people living in europe he would rather have been in america and he had discovered writing he wrote a novel and it was not really such a bad novel as the critics later called it although it was a very poor novel he read many books played bridge played tennis and boxed at a local gymnasium i first became aware of his ladys attitude toward him one night after the three of us had dined together we had dined at lavenues and afterward went to the cafe de versailles for coffee we had several fines after the coffee and i said i must be going cohn had been talking about the two of us going off somewhere on a weekend trip he wanted to get out of town and get in a good walk i suggested we fly to strasbourg and walk up to saint odile or somewhere or other in alsace i know a girl in strasbourg who can show us the town i said somebody kicked me under the table i thought it was accidental and went on shes been there two years and knows everything there is to know about the town shes a swell girl i was kicked again under the table and looking saw frances roberts lady her chin lifting and her face hardening hell i said why go to strasbourg we could go up to bruges or to the ardennes cohn looked relieved i was not kicked again i said goodnight and went out cohn said he wanted to buy a paper and would walk to the corner with me for gods sake he said why did you say that about that girl in strasbourg for didnt you see frances no why should i if i know an american girl that lives in strasbourg what the hell is it to frances it doesnt make any difference any girl i couldnt go that would be all dont be silly you dont know frances any girl at all didnt you see the way she looked oh well i said lets go to senlis dont get sore im not sore senlis is a good place and we can stay at the grand cerf and take a hike in the woods and come home good that will be fine well ill see you tomorrow at the courts i said goodnight jake he said and started back to the cafe you forgot to get your paper i said thats so he walked with me up to the kiosque at the corner you are not sore are you jake he turned with the paper in his hand no why should i be see you at tennis he said i watched him walk back to the cafe holding his paper i rather liked him and evidently she led him quite a life
