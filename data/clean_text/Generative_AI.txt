generative artificial intelligence also known as generative ai or genai is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to generate text images videos audio software code or other forms of data these models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to generate new data in response to input which often takes the form of natural language prompts the prevalence of generative ai tools has increased significantly since the ai boom in the s this boom was made possible by improvements in deep neural networks particularly large language models llms which are based on the transformer architecture generative ai applications include chatbots such as chatgpt claude copilot deepseek google gemini and grok texttoimage models such as stable diffusion midjourney and dalle and texttovideo models such as veo ltx and sora companies in a variety of sectors have used generative ai including those in software development healthcare finance entertainment customer service sales and marketing art writing and product design generative ai has been used for cybercrime and to deceive and manipulate people through fake news and deepfakes generative ai models have been trained on copyrighted works without the rightholders permission many generative ai systems use largescale data centers whose environmental impacts include ewaste consumption of fresh water for cooling and high energy consumption that is estimated to be growing steadily history early history the origins of algorithmically generated media can be traced to the development of the markov chain which has been used to model natural language since the early th century russian mathematician andrey markov introduced the concept in  including an analysis of vowel and consonant patterns in eugeny onegin once trained on a text corpus a markov chain can generate probabilistic text by the early s artists began using computers to extend generative techniques beyond markov models harold cohen developed and exhibited works produced by aaron a pioneering computer program designed to autonomously create paintings the terms generative ai planning or generative planning were used in the s and s to refer to ai planning systems especially computeraided process planning used to generate sequences of actions to reach a specified goal generative ai planning systems used symbolic ai methods such as state space search and constraint satisfaction and were a relatively mature technology by the early s they were used to generate crisis action plans for military use process plans for manufacturing and decision plans such as in prototype autonomous spacecraft generative neural networks since the late s machine learning uses both discriminative models and generative models to predict data beginning in the late s the introduction of deep learning technology led to improvements in image classification speech recognition natural language processing and other tasks neural networks in this era were typically trained as discriminative models due to the difficulty of generative modeling in  advancements such as the variational autoencoder and generative adversarial network produced the first practical deep neural networks capable of learning generative models as opposed to discriminative ones for complex data such as images these deep generative models were the first to output not only class labels for images but also entire images such as deepdream in  the transformer network enabled advancements in generative models compared to older long shortterm memory lstm models leading to the first generative pretrained transformer gpt known as gpt in  generative ai adoption in march  the release of ai a free web application created by an anonymous mit researcher that could generate convincing character voices using minimal training data marked one of the earliest popular use cases of generative ai the platform is credited as the first mainstream service for ai voice cloning audio deepfakes in memes and content creation in  the emergence of dalle a transformerbased generative model marked an advance in aigenerated imagery while the initial model remained a closedaccess tool opensource google colab projects and initiatives like vqganclip or dalle mini now craiyon were the first widelyused public texttoimage generation models by the end of  mobile applications such as dream by wombo allowed users to generate art from a simple prompts this was followed by the releases of midjourney and stable diffusion in  which further democratized access to artificial intelligence art creation from natural language prompts these systems can generate photorealistic images artwork and designs based on text descriptions leading to widespread adoption among artists designers and the general public in november  the public release of chatgpt popularized generative ai for generalpurpose textbased tasks the systems ability to engage in natural conversations generate creative content assist with coding and perform various analytical tasks captured global attention and sparked widespread discussion about ais potential impact on work education and creativity as of  generative ai remained still far from reaching the benchmark of general human intelligence according to a paper in the journal of information technology in a  survey asiapacific countries were significantly more optimistic than western societies about generative ai and show higher adoption rates despite expressing concerns about privacy and the pace of change  of asiapacific respondents believed that ai was having a positive impact on the world compared to  globally according to a survey by sas and coleman parkes research china in particular has emerged as a global leader in generative ai adoption with  of chinese respondents using the technology exceeding both the global average of  and the us rate of  a un report indicated that chinese entities filed over  generative ai patents from  to  substantially surpassing the united states in patent applications a  survey on the chinese social app soul reported that  of respondents born after  used generative ai almost every day and that over  of respondents like or love aigenerated content while less than  dislike or hate it by mid  despite continued consumer growth many companies were increasingly abandoning generative ai pilot projects as they had difficulties with integration data quality and unmet returns leading analysts at gartner and the economist to characterize the period as entering the gartner hype cycles trough of disillusionment phase applications notable types of generative ai models include generative pretrained transformers gpts generative adversarial networks gans and variational autoencoders vaes generative ai systems are multimodal if they can process multiple types of inputs or generate multiple types of outputs for example gpto can both process and generate text images and audio generative ai has made its appearance in a wide variety of industries radically changing the dynamics of content creation analysis and delivery in healthcare for instance generative ai accelerates drug discovery by creating molecular structures with target characteristics and generates radiology images for training diagnostic models this ability not only enables faster and cheaper development but also enhances medical decisionmaking in finance generative ai services help create datasets and automate reports using natural language it automates content creation produces synthetic financial data and tailors customer communications it also powers chatbots and virtual agents the media industry makes use of generative ai for numerous creative activities such as music composition scriptwriting video editing and digital art the educational sector is impacted as well since the tools make learning personalized through creating quizzes study aids and essay composition in the educational field in colombia student use of metas generative ai programs resulted in a decline in scores text and software code large language models llm are trained on tokenized text from text corpora such systems include chatgpt gemini claude llama and bloom llms are capable of natural language processing machine translation and natural language generation llms can be used as foundation models for other tasks they can be trained on computer code which makes it possible to generate source code for new computer programs with prompts a practice known as vibe coding examples include openai codex tabnine github copilot microsoft copilot and the vs code fork cursor some ai assistants help candidates cheat during online coding interviews by providing code improvements and explanations their clandestine interfaces minimize the need for eye movements that would expose cheating to the interviewer audio in  deepminds wavenet showed that deep neural networks are capable of generating raw waveforms wavenets ability to model raw waveforms meant that it could model any kind of audio including music for example it was capable of generating relatively realisticsounding humanlike voices by training on recordings of real speech in subsequent years research shifted from concatenative synthesis to deep learning speech synthesis with models like tacotron  in  demonstrating that neural networks could convert text into natural speech by being trained on tens of hours of speech in  a free texttospeech website called ai showed that deep neural networks could generate emotionally expressive speech with only  seconds of speech a large reduction compared to the tens of hours of data previously required other platforms that use generative ai to produce speech include amazon polly metas voicebox and elevenlabs audio deepfakes have been used to generate vocal tracks of lyrics that mimic the voices of other singers images generative ai can be used to create visual art such systems are trained on sets of images along with their text captions examples of texttoimage models include stable diffusion dalle midjourney imagen recraft adobe firefly and flux they can also be used for neural style transfer video generative ai can be used to generate photorealistic videos examples include sora by openai runway makeavideo by meta platforms and the open source ltx video by lightricks robotics by training on robotic system motions generative ai can create new trajectories for motion planning and robot navigation multimodal visionlanguageaction models such as googles rt can perform rudimentary reasoning in response to user prompts and visual input such as picking up a toy dinosaur when given the prompt pick up the extinct animal at a table filled with toy animals and other objects d modeling artificially intelligent computeraided design cad can use texttod imagetod and videotod to automate d modeling aibased cad libraries could also be developed using linked open data of schematics and diagrams ai cad assistants are used as tools to help streamline workflow software and hardware generative ai models are used to power chatbot products such as chatgpt programming tools such as github copilot texttoimage products such as midjourney and texttovideo products such as runway gen generative ai features have been integrated into a variety of existing commercially available products such as microsoft office microsoft copilot google photos and the adobe suite adobe firefly many generative ai models are also available as opensource software including stable diffusion and the llama language model smaller generative ai models with up to a few billion parameters can run on smartphones embedded devices and personal computers for example llamab a version with  billion parameters can run on a raspberry pi  and one version of stable diffusion can run on an iphone  larger models with tens of billions of parameters can run on laptop or desktop computers to achieve an acceptable speed models of this size may require accelerators such as the gpu chips produced by nvidia and amd or the neural engine included in apple silicon products for example the  billion parameter version of llama can be configured to run on a desktop pc the advantages of running generative ai locally include protection of privacy and intellectual property and avoidance of rate limiting and censorship the subreddit rlocalllama in particular focuses on using consumergrade gaming graphics cards through such techniques as compression language models with hundreds of billions of parameters such as gpt or palm typically run on datacenter computers equipped with arrays of gpus such as nvidias h or ai accelerator chips such as googles tpu these very large models are typically accessed as cloud services over the internet in  the united states new export controls on advanced computing and semiconductors to china imposed restrictions on exports to china of gpu and ai accelerator chips used for generative ai chips such as the nvidia a and the biren technology br were developed to meet the requirements of the sanctions there is free software on the market capable of recognizing text generated by generative artificial intelligence such as gptzero as well as images audio or video coming from it potential mitigation strategies for detecting generative ai content include digital watermarking content authentication information retrieval and machine learning classifier models despite claims of accuracy both free and paid ai text detectors have frequently produced false positives mistakenly accusing students of submitting aigenerated work generative models and training techniques generative adversarial networks generative adversarial networks gans are a generative modeling technique which consist of two neural networksthe generator and the discriminatortrained simultaneously in a competitive setting the generator creates synthetic data by transforming random noise into samples that resemble the training dataset the discriminator is trained to distinguish the authentic data from synthetic data produced by the generator the two models engage in a minimax game the generator aims to create increasingly realistic data to fool the discriminator while the discriminator improves its ability to distinguish real from fake data this continuous training setup enables the generator to produce highquality and realistic outputs variational autoencoders variational autoencoders vaes are deep learning models that probabilistically encode data they are typically used for tasks such as noise reduction from images data compression identifying unusual patterns and facial recognition unlike standard autoencoders which compress input data into a fixed latent representation vaes model the latent space as a probability distribution allowing for smooth sampling and interpolation between data points the encoder recognition model maps input data to a latent space producing means and variances that define a probability distribution the decoder generative model samples from this latent distribution and attempts to reconstruct the original input vaes optimize a loss function that includes both the reconstruction error and a kullbackleibler divergence term which ensures the latent space follows a known prior distribution vaes are particularly suitable for tasks that require structured but smooth latent spaces although they may create blurrier images than gans they are used for applications like image generation data interpolation and anomaly detection transformers transformers became the foundation for many powerful generative models most notably the generative pretrained transformer gpt series developed by openai they marked a major shift in natural language processing by replacing traditional recurrent and convolutional models this architecture allows models to process entire sequences simultaneously and capture longrange dependencies more efficiently the selfattention mechanism enables the model to capture the significance of every word in a sequence when predicting the subsequent word thus improving its contextual understanding unlike recurrent neural networks transformers process all the tokens in parallel which improves the training efficiency and scalability transformers are typically pretrained on enormous corpora in a selfsupervised manner prior to being finetuned law and regulation in the united states a group of companies including openai alphabet and meta signed a voluntary agreement with the biden administration in july  to watermark aigenerated content in october  executive order  applied the defense production act to require all us companies to report information to the federal government when training certain highimpact ai models in the european union the proposed artificial intelligence act includes requirements to disclose copyrighted material used to train generative ai systems and to label any aigenerated output as such in china the interim measures for the management of generative ai services introduced by the cyberspace administration of china regulates any publicfacing generative ai it includes requirements to watermark generated images or videos regulations on training data and label quality restrictions on personal data collection and a guideline that generative ai services must adhere to socialist core values copyright training with copyrighted content generative ai systems such as chatgpt and midjourney are trained on large publicly available datasets that include copyrighted works ai developers have argued that such training is protected under fair use while copyright holders have argued that it infringes their rights proponents of fair use training have argued that it is a transformative use and does not involve making copies of copyrighted works available to the public critics have argued that image generators such as midjourney can create nearlyidentical copies of some copyrighted images and that generative ai programs compete with the content they are trained on as of  several lawsuits related to the use of copyrighted material in training are ongoing getty images has sued stability ai over the use of its images to train stable diffusion both the authors guild and the new york times have sued microsoft and openai over the use of their works to train chatgpt copyright of aigenerated content a separate question is whether aigenerated works can qualify for copyright protection the united states copyright office has ruled that works created by artificial intelligence without any human input cannot be copyrighted because they lack human authorship some legal professionals have suggested that naruto v slater  in which the us th circuit court of appeals held that nonhumans cannot be copyright holders of artistic works could be a potential precedent in copyright litigation over works created by generative ai however the office has also begun taking public input to determine if these rules need to be refined for generative ai in january  the united states copyright office usco released extensive guidance regarding the use of ai tools in the creative process and established that generative ai systems also offer tools that similarly allow users to exert control these can enable the user to control the selection and placement of individual creative elements whether such modifications rise to the minimum standard of originality required under feist will depend on a casebycase determination in those cases where they do the output should be copyrightable subsequently the usco registered the first visual artwork to be composed of entirely aigenerated materials titled a single piece of american cheese concerns the development of generative ai has raised concerns from governments businesses and individuals resulting in protests legal actions calls to pause ai experiments and actions by multiple governments in a july  briefing of the united nations security council secretarygeneral antonio guterres stated generative ai has enormous potential for good and evil at scale that ai may turbocharge global development and contribute between  and  trillion to the global economy by  but that its malicious use could cause horrific levels of death and destruction widespread trauma and deep psychological damage on an unimaginable scale in addition generative ai has a significant carbon footprint academic honesty generative ai can be used to generate and modify academic prose to paraphrase sources and translate languages the use of generative ai in a classroom setting can be a form of academic plagiarism some schools have banned chatgpt and similar tools a commonly proposed use for teachers is grading and giving feedback companies like pearson and ets use ai to score grammar mechanics usage and style but not for main ideas or overall structure the national council of teachers of english stated that machine scoring makes students feel their writing is not worth reading ai scoring has also given unfair results for students from different ethnic backgrounds fears over job losses from the early days of the development of ai there have been arguments put forward by eliza creator joseph weizenbaum and others about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them given the difference between computers and humans and between quantitative calculations and qualitative valuebased judgements in april  it was reported that image generation ai has resulted in  of the jobs for video game illustrators in china being lost in july  developments in generative ai contributed to the  hollywood labor disputes fran drescher president of the screen actors guild declared that artificial intelligence poses an existential threat to creative professions during the  sagaftra strike voice generation ai has been seen as a potential challenge to the voice acting sector however a  study concluded that the us labor market had so far not experienced a discernible disruption from generative ai another study reported that danish workers who used chatbots saved  of their time on average and found no significant change in earnings or hours worked racial and gender bias generative ai models can reflect and amplify any cultural bias present in the underlying data for example a language model might assume that doctors and judges are male and that secretaries or nurses are female if those biases are common in the training data similarly an image model prompted with the text a photo of a ceo might disproportionately generate images of white male ceos if trained on a racially biased data set a number of methods for mitigating bias have been attempted such as altering input prompts and reweighting training data deepfakes deepfakes a portmanteau of deep learning and fake are aigenerated media that take a person in an existing image or video and replace them with someone elses likeness using artificial neural networks deepfakes have garnered widespread attention and concerns for their uses in deepfake celebrity pornographic videos revenge porn fake news hoaxes health disinformation financial fraud and covert foreign election interference in july  the factchecking company logically found that the popular generative ai models midjourney dalle  and stable diffusion would produce plausible disinformation images when prompted to do so such as images of electoral fraud in the united states and muslim women supporting indias hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party audio deepfakes instances of users abusing software to generate controversial statements in the vocal style of celebrities public officials and other famous individuals have raised ethical concerns over voice generation ai in response companies such as elevenlabs have stated that they would work on mitigating potential abuse through safeguards and identity verification concerns and fandoms have spawned from aigenerated music the same software used to clone voices has been used on famous musicians voices to create songs that mimic their voices gaining both tremendous popularity and criticism similar techniques have also been used to create improved quality or fulllength versions of songs that have been leaked or have yet to be released illegal imagery many websites that allow explicit ai generated images or videos have been created and this has been used to create illegal content such as rape child sexual abuse material necrophilia and zoophilia cybercrime generative ais ability to create realistic fake content has been exploited in numerous types of cybercrime including phishing scams deepfake video and audio have been used to create disinformation and fraud in  former google click fraud czar shuman ghosemajumder argued that once deepfake videos become perfectly realistic they would stop appearing remarkable to viewers potentially leading to uncritical acceptance of false information additionally large language models and other forms of textgeneration ai have been used to create fake reviews of ecommerce websites to boost ratings cybercriminals have created large language models focused on fraud including wormgpt and fraudgpt a  study showed that generative ai can be vulnerable to jailbreaks reverse psychology and prompt injection attacks enabling attackers to obtain help with harmful requests such as for crafting social engineering and phishing attacks additionally other researchers have demonstrated that opensource models can be finetuned to remove their safety restrictions at low cost information laundering generative ai has been noted for its use by statesponsored propaganda campaigns in information laundering according to a  report by graphika generative ai is used to launder articles from chinese state media such as china global television network through various social media sites in an attempt to disguise the articles origin reliance on industry giants training frontier ai models requires an enormous amount of computing power usually only big tech companies have the financial resources to make such investments smaller startups such as cohere and openai end up buying access to data centers from google and microsoft respectively energy and environment ai has a significant carbon footprint due to growing energy consumption from both training and usage scientists and journalists have expressed concerns about the environmental impact that the development and deployment of generative models are having high co emissions large amounts of freshwater used for data centers and high amounts of electricity usage there is also concern that these impacts may increase as these models are incorporated into widely used search engines such as google search and bing as chatbots and other applications become more popular and as models need to be retrained the carbon footprint of generative ai globally is estimated to be growing steadily with potential annual emissions ranging from  to  million tons of co by  with the highest estimates for  nearing the impact of the united states beef industry on emissions currently estimated to emit  million tons annually as of  proposed mitigation strategies include factoring potential environmental costs prior to model development or data collection increasing efficiency of data centers to reduce electricityenergy usage building more efficient machine learning models minimizing the number of times that models need to be retrained developing a governmentdirected framework for auditing the environmental impact of these models regulating for transparency of these models regulating their energy and water usage encouraging researchers to publish data on their models carbon footprint and increasing the number of subject matter experts who understand both machine learning and climate science content quality the new york times defines slop as analogous to spam shoddy or unwanted ai content in social media art books and  in search results journalists have expressed concerns about the scale of lowquality generated content with respect to social media content moderation the monetary incentives from social media companies to spread such content false political messaging spamming of scientific research paper submissions increased time and effort to find higher quality or desired content on the internet the indexing of generated content by search engines and on journalism itself studies have found that ai can create inaccurate claims citations or summaries that sound confidently correct a phenomenon called hallucination a paper published by researchers at amazon web services ai labs found that over  of sentences from a sample of over  billion sentences from common crawl a snapshot of web pages were machine translated many of these automated translations were seen as lower quality especially for sentences that were translated into at least three languages many lowerresource languages ex wolof xhosa were translated across more languages than higherresource languages ex english french in september  robyn speer the author of wordfreq an open source database that calculated word frequencies based on text from the internet announced that she had stopped updating the data for several reasons high costs for obtaining data from reddit and twitter excessive focus on generative ai compared to other methods in the natural language processing community and that generative ai has polluted the data the adoption of generative ai tools led to an explosion of aigenerated content across multiple domains a study from university college london estimated that in  more than  scholarly articlesover  of all publicationswere likely written with llm assistance according to stanford universitys institute for humancentered ai approximately  of newly published computer science papers and  of peer review text now incorporate content generated by llms if aigenerated content is included in new data crawls from the internet for additional training of ai models defects in the resulting models may occur training an ai model exclusively on the output of another ai model produces a lowerquality model repeating this process where each new model is trained on the previous models output leads to progressive degradation and eventually results in a model collapse after multiple iterations on the other side synthetic data can be deployed to train machine learning models while preserving user privacy the approach is not limited to text generation image generation has been employed to train computer vision models use in journalism in january  futurism broke the story that cnet had been using an undisclosed internal ai tool to write at least  of its stories after the news broke cnet posted corrections to  of the stories in april  die aktuelle published an aigenerated fake interview of michael schumacher in may  futurism noted that a content management system video by advon commerce which had used generative ai to produce articles for many of the aforementioned outlets appeared to show that they had produced tens of thousands of articles for more than  publishers in  a report from the american sunlight project stated that pravda network was publishing as many as  articles a day and concluded that much of this content aimed to push russian narratives into large language models through their training data in june  reuters institute published its digital news report for  in a survey of people in america and europe reuters institute reports that  and  respectively are uncomfortable with news produced by mostly ai with some human oversight and  and  respectively report being comfortable  of americans and  of europeans reported that they were comfortable with news produced by mainly human with some help from ai the results of global surveys reported that people were more uncomfortable with news topics including politics  crime  and local news  produced by ai than other news topics a  pew research survey found roughly half of all us adults say that ai will have a very  or somewhat  negative impact on the news people get in the us over the next  years because ai cannot do journalism which requires interviewing people and a high degree of accuracy ai poses a greater threat to journalism from the information it takes from publishers rag poisoning in  israel signed a m contract with the us based firm clock tower x that aimed to influence chatgpt gemini and grok by flooding proisrael information on to social media and websites this was in an attempt to take advantage of the retrievalaugmented generation rag technique which is used by llms to provide more uptodate information extraterritorial data access the cloud act allows united states authorities to request data from covered service providers including some ai service providers regardless of where the data is physically stored courts can require parent companies to provide data held by their subsidiaries and such orders may be accompanied by nondisclosure requirements preventing the provider from notifying affected users this framework has been described in legal commentary as creating legal tension with article  of the general data protection regulation gdpr which restricts the transfer of personal data in response to foreign court or administrative orders unless based on an international agreement as a result service providers operating in both jurisdictions may face competing legal obligations under us and eu law detection and awareness tools such as gptzero can detect content generated by ai however they can also make false accusations false positives digital watermarking is a technique that improves detection accuracy it works by altering the generated content at the source in subtle ways which can be detected by corresponding software in  openai developed a watermarking tool for chatgpt they didnt release it because they worried that users would switch to competitors they also argued that it would be easy to defeat with superficial rephrasing in march  the cyberspace administration of china issued rules requiring online service providers to label ai content in may  google deployed its watermarking tool synthid it marks output from gemini text imagen images and veo video to detect output from these products one uses googles synthid detector portal in june  users
