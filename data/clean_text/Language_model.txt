a language model is a computational model that predicts sequences in natural language language models are useful for a variety of tasks including speech recognition machine translation natural language generation generating more humanlike text optical character recognition route optimization handwriting recognition grammar induction and information retrieval large language models llms currently their most advanced form as of  are predominantly based on transformers trained on larger datasets frequently using texts scraped from the public internet they have superseded recurrent neural networkbased models which had previously superseded the purely statistical models such as the word ngram language model history noam chomsky did pioneering work on language models in the s by developing a theory of formal grammars in  statistical approaches were explored and found to be more useful for many purposes than rulebased formal grammars discrete representations like word ngram language models with probabilities for discrete combinations of words made significant advances in the s continuous representations for words such as word embeddings began to replace discrete representations typically the representation is a realvalued vector that encodes the meaning of the word in such a way that the words that are closer in the vector space are expected to be similar in meaning and common relationships between pairs of words like plurality or gender pure statistical models in  the first significant statistical language model was proposed and during the decade ibm performed shannonstyle experiments in which potential sources for language modeling improvement were identified by observing and analyzing the performance of human subjects in predicting or correcting text models based on word ngrams exponential maximum entropy language models encode the relationship between a word and the ngram history using feature functions the equation is p  w m  w     w m      z  w     w m    exp   a t f  w     w m   displaystyle pwmmid wldots wmfrac zwldots wmexpatfwldots wm where z  w     w m    displaystyle zwldots wm is the partition function a displaystyle a is the parameter vector and f  w     w m  displaystyle fwldots wm is the feature function in the simplest case the feature function is just an indicator of the presence of a certain ngram it is helpful to use a prior on a displaystyle a or some form of regularization the logbilinear model is another example of an exponential language model skipgram model neural models recurrent neural network continuous representations or embeddings of words are produced in recurrent neural networkbased language models known also as continuous space language models such continuous space embeddings help to alleviate the curse of dimensionality which is the consequence of the number of possible sequences of words increasing exponentially with the size of the vocabulary further causing a data sparsity problem neural networks avoid this problem by representing words as nonlinear combinations of weights in a neural net large language models although sometimes matching human performance it is not clear whether they are plausible cognitive models at least for recurrent neural networks it has been shown that they sometimes learn patterns that humans do not but fail to learn patterns that humans typically do evaluation and benchmarks evaluation of the quality of language models is mostly done by comparison to human created sample benchmarks created from typical languageoriented tasks other less established quality tests examine the intrinsic character of a language model or compare two such models since language models are typically intended to be dynamic and to learn from data they see some proposed models investigate the rate of learning eg through inspection of learning curves various data sets have been developed for use in evaluating language processing systems these include massive multitask language understanding mmlu corpus of linguistic acceptability glue benchmark microsoft research paraphrase corpus multigenre natural language inference question natural language inference quora question pairs recognizing textual entailment semantic textual similarity benchmark squad question answering test stanford sentiment treebank winograd nli boolq piqa siqa hellaswag winogrande arc openbookqa naturalquestions triviaqa race bigbench hard gsmk realtoxicityprompts winogender crowspairs see also references  further reading
