the new wave french nouvelle vague french pronunciation nuvl va also called the french new wave is a french art film movement that emerged in the late s the movement was characterized by its rejection of traditional filmmaking conventions favoring experimentation and a spirit of iconoclasm new wave filmmakers explored new approaches to editing visual style and narrative often engaging with the social and political upheavals of the era through the use of irony or the exploration of existential themes the new wave is often considered one of the most influential movements in the history of cinema the term was first used by a group of french film critics and cinephiles associated with the magazine cahiers du cinema in the late s and s these critics rejected the tradition de qualite tradition of quality of mainstream french cinema which emphasized craft over innovation and old works over experimentation this was apparent in a manifestolike  essay by francois truffaut une certaine tendance du cinema francais where he denounced the adaptation of safe literary works into unimaginative films along with truffaut a number of writers for cahiers du cinema became leading new wave filmmakers including jeanluc godard eric rohmer jacques rivette and claude chabrol the associated left bank film community included directors such as alain resnais agnes varda jacques demy and chris marker using portable equipment and requiring little or no set up time the new wave way of filmmaking often presented a documentary style the films exhibited direct sounds on film stock that required less light filming techniques included fragmented discontinuous editing and long takes the combination of realism subjectivity and authorial commentary created a narrative ambiguity in the sense that questions that arise in a film are not answered in the end although naturally associated with francophone countries the movement has had a continual influence within various other cinephile cultures over the past several decades the united kingdom and the united states both of them being primarily englishspeaking are of note kitchen sink realism as an artistic approach intellectually challenging social conventions and traditions in the uk is an example as are some elements of the new sincerity subculture within the us that involve deliberately defying certain critical expectations in filmmaking origins of the movement alexandre astrucs manifesto the birth of a new avantgarde the camerastylo published in lecran on  march  outlined some of the ideas that were later expanded upon by francois truffaut and the cahiers du cinema it argues that cinema was in the process of becoming a new means of expression on the same level as painting and the novel  a form in which and by which an artist can express his thoughts however abstract they may be or translate his obsessions exactly as he does in the contemporary essay or novel this is why i would like to call this new age of cinema the age of the camerastylo some of the most prominent pioneers among the group including francois truffaut jeanluc godard eric rohmer claude chabrol and jacques rivette began as critics for the film magazine cahiers du cinema cahiers cofounder and theorist andre bazin was a prominent source of influence for the movement by means of criticism and editorialization they laid the groundwork for a set of concepts revolutionary at the time which the american film critic andrew sarris called auteur theory the original french la politique des auteurs translated literally as the policy of authors bazin and henri langlois founder and curator of the cinematheque francaise were the dual father figures of the movement these men of cinema valued the expression of the directors personal vision in both the films style and script truffaut also credits the american film little fugitive  by ruth orkin ray ashley and morris engel with helping to start the french new wave when he said our new wave would never have come into being if it hadnt been for the young american morris engel who showed us the way to independent production with this fine movie the auteur theory holds that the director is the author of their movies with a personal signature visible from film to film they praised movies by jean renoir and jean vigo and made thenradical cases for the artistic distinction and greatness of hollywood studio directors such as orson welles john ford alfred hitchcock and nicholas ray the beginning of the new wave was to some extent an exercise by the cahiers writers in applying this philosophy to the world by directing movies themselves apart from the role that films by jean rouch have played in the movement chabrols le beau serge  is traditionally but debatably credited as the first new wave feature agnes vardas la pointe courte  was chronologically the first but did not have a commercial release until  truffaut with the  blows  and godard with breathless  had unexpected international successes both critical and financial that turned the worlds attention to the activities of the new wave and enabled the movement to flourish part of their technique was to portray characters not readily labeled as protagonists in the classic sense of audience identification the auteurs of this era owe their popularity to the support they received from their youthful audience most of these directors were born in the s and grew up in paris relating to how their viewers might be experiencing life with a high concentration on fashion urban professional life and allnight parties the life of frances youth was exquisitely captured the french new wave was popular roughly between  and  the socioeconomic forces at play shortly after world war ii strongly influenced the movement politically and financially drained france tended to fall back on the old popular prewar traditions one such tradition was straight narrative cinema specifically classical french film the movement has its roots in rebellion against the reliance on past forms often adapted from traditional novelistic structures criticizing in particular the way these forms could force the audience to submit to a dictatorial plotline they were especially against the french cinema of quality the type of highminded literary period films held in esteem at french film festivals often regarded as untouchable by criticism new wave critics and directors studied the work of western classics and applied new avantgarde stylistic direction the lowbudget approach helped filmmakers get at the essential art form and find what was to them a much more comfortable and contemporary form of production charlie chaplin alfred hitchcock orson welles howard hawks john ford sam fuller and don siegel were held up in admiration french new wave is influenced by italian neorealism and classical hollywood cinema in a  interview truffaut said that the new wave is neither a movement nor a school nor a group its a quality and in december  published a list of  film directors who had made their feature film debut since  many of these directors such as edmond agabra and henri zaphiratos were not as successful or enduring as the wellknown members of the new wave and today would not be considered part of it shortly after truffauts published list appeared godard publicly declared that the new wave was more exclusive and included only truffaut chabrol rivette rohmer and himself stating that cahiers was the nucleus of the movement godard also acknowledged filmmakers such as resnais astruc varda and demy as esteemed contemporaries but said that they represented their own fund of culture and were separate from the new wave many of the directors associated with the new wave continued to make films into the st century film techniques the movies featured unprecedented methods of expression such as long tracking shots like the famous traffic jam sequence in godards  film weekend also these movies featured existential themes often stressing the individual and the acceptance of the absurdity of human existence filled with irony and sarcasm the films also tend to reference other films many of the french new wave films were produced on tight budgets often shot in a friends apartment or yard using the directors friends as the cast and crew directors were also forced to improvise with equipment for example using a shopping cart for tracking shots the cost of film was also a major concern thus efforts to save film turned into stylistic innovations for example in jeanluc godards breathless a bout de souffle after being told the film was too long and he must cut it down to one hour and a half he decided on the suggestion of jeanpierre melville to remove several scenes from the feature using jump cuts as they were filmed in one long take parts that did not work were simply cut from the middle of the take a practical decision and also a purposeful stylistic one the cinematic stylings of the french new wave brought a fresh look to the cinema with improvised dialogue rapid changes of scene and shots that broke the common  axis of camera movement in many films of the french new wave the camera was used not to mesmerize the audience with elaborate narrative and illusory images but rather to play with audience expectations godard was arguably the movements most influential figure his method of filmmaking often used to shock and awe audiences out of passivity was abnormally bold and direct godards stylistic approach can be seen as a desperate struggle against the mainstream cinema of the time or a degrading attack on the viewers supposed naivety either way the challenging awareness represented by this movement remains in cinema today effects that now seem either trite or commonplace such as a character stepping out of their role in order to address the audience directly were radically innovative at the time classic french cinema adhered to the principles of strong narrative creating what godard described as an oppressive and deterministic aesthetic of plot in contrast new wave filmmakers made no attempts to suspend the viewers disbelief in fact they took steps to constantly remind the viewer that a film is just a sequence of moving images no matter how clever the use of light and shadow the result is a set of oddly disjointed scenes without an attempt at unity or an actor whose character changes from one scene to the next or sets in which onlookers accidentally make their way onto camera along with extras who in fact were hired to do just the same at the heart of new wave technique is the issue of money and production value in the context of social and economic troubles of a postworld war ii france filmmakers sought lowbudget alternatives to the usual production methods and were inspired by the generation of italian neorealists before them half necessity and half vision new wave directors used all that they had available to channel their artistic visions directly to the theatre finally the french new wave as the european modern cinema is focused on the technique as style itself a french new wave filmmaker is first of all an author who shows in its film their own eye on the world on the other hand the film as the object of knowledge challenges the usual transitivity on which all the other cinema was based undoing its cornerstones space and time continuity narrative and grammatical logics the selfevidence of the represented worlds in this way the filmmaker passes the essay attitude thinking  in a novelist way  on his own way to do essays left bank the corresponding right bank group is constituted of the more famous and financially successful new wave directors associated with cahiers du cinema claude chabrol francois truffaut and jeanluc godard unlike the cahiers group left bank directors were older and less moviecrazed they tended to see cinema akin to other arts such as literature however they were similar to the new wave directors in that they practiced cinematic modernism their emergence also came in the s and they also benefited from the youthful audience the two groups however were not in opposition cahiers du cinema advocated for left bank cinema left bank directors include chris marker alain resnais and agnes varda vardas husband jacques demy is sometimes grouped with the left bank filmmakers roud described a distinctive fondness for a kind of bohemian life and an impatience with the conformity of the right bank a high degree of involvement in literature and the plastic arts and a consequent interest in experimental filmmaking as well as an identification with the political left the filmmakers tended to collaborate with one another jeanpierre melville alain robbegrillet and marguerite duras are also associated with the group the nouveau roman movement in literature was also a strong element of the left bank style with authors contributing to many of the films left bank films include la pointe courte hiroshima mon amour la jetee last year at marienbad and transeuropexpress criticism some early stcentury critics have argued that the movement has sexist
