corpus linguistics is an empirical method for the study of language by text corpus plural corpora corpora are balanced often stratified collections of authentic real world text of speech or writing that aim to represent a given linguistic variety today corpora are generally machinereadable data collections corpus linguistics proposes that a reliable analysis of a language is more feasible with corpora collected in the fieldthe natural context realia of that languagewith minimal experimental interference large collections of text though corpora may also be small in terms of running words allow linguists to run quantitative analyses on linguistic concepts that may be difficult to test in a qualitative manner the textcorpus method uses the body of texts in any natural language to derive the set of abstract rules which govern that language those results can be used to explore the relationships between that subject language and other languages which have undergone a similar analysis the first such corpora were manually derived from source texts but now that work is automated corpora have not only been used for linguistics research they have been increasingly used to compile dictionaries starting with the american heritage dictionary of the english language in  and reference grammars with a comprehensive grammar of the english language published in  as a first experts in the field have differing views about the annotation of a corpus these views range from john mchardy sinclair who advocates minimal annotation so texts speak for themselves to the survey of english usage team university college london who advocate annotation as allowing greater linguistic understanding through rigorous recording history some of the earliest efforts at grammatical description were based at least in part on corpora of particular religious or cultural significance for example pratisakhya literature described the sound patterns of sanskrit as found in the vedas and paninis grammar of classical sanskrit was based at least in part on analysis of that same corpus similarly the early arabic grammarians paid particular attention to the language of the quran in the western european tradition scholars prepared concordances to allow detailed study of the language of the bible and other canonical texts english corpora a landmark in modern corpus linguistics was the publication of computational analysis of presentday american english in  written by henry kucera and w nelson francis the work was based on an analysis of the brown corpus which is a structured and balanced corpus of one million words of american english from the year  the corpus comprises  text samples from a variety of genres the brown corpus was the first computerized corpus designed for linguistic research kucera and francis subjected the brown corpus to a variety of computational analyses and then combined elements of linguistics language teaching psychology statistics and sociology to create a rich and variegated opus a further key publication was randolph quirks towards a description of english usage in  in which he introduced the survey of english usage quirks corpus was the first modern corpus to be built with the purpose of representing the whole language shortly thereafter boston publisher houghtonmifflin approached kucera to supply a millionword threeline citation base for its new american heritage dictionary the first dictionary compiled using corpus linguistics the ahd took the innovative step of combining prescriptive elements how language should be used with descriptive information how it actually is used other publishers followed suit the british publisher collins cobuild monolingual learners dictionary designed for users learning english as a foreign language was compiled using the bank of english the survey of english usage corpus was used in the development of one of the most important corpusbased grammars which was written by quirk et al and published in  as a comprehensive grammar of the english language the brown corpus has also spawned a number of similarly structured corpora the lob corpus s british english kolhapur indian english wellington new zealand english australian corpus of english australian english the frown corpus early s american english and the flob corpus s british english other corpora represent many languages varieties and modes and include the international corpus of english and the british national corpus a  million word collection of a range of spoken and written texts created in the s by a consortium of publishers universities oxford and lancaster and the british library for contemporary american english work has stalled on the american national corpus but the  million word corpus of contemporary american english present is now available through a web interface the first computerized corpus of transcribed spoken language was constructed in  by the montreal french project containing one million words which inspired shana poplacks much larger corpus of spoken french in the ottawahull area multilingual corpora in the s many of the notable early successes on statistical methods in naturallanguage programming nlp occurred in the field of machine translation due especially to work at ibm research these systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual textual corpora that had been produced by the parliament of canada and the european union as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government there are corpora in noneuropean languages as well for example the national institute for japanese language and linguistics in japan has built a number of corpora of spoken and written japanese sign language corpora have also been created using video data ancient languages corpora besides these corpora of living languages computerized corpora have also been made of collections of texts in ancient languages an example is the andersenforbes database of the hebrew bible developed since the s in which every clause is parsed using graphs representing up to seven levels of syntax and every segment tagged with seven fields of information the quranic arabic corpus is an annotated corpus for the classical arabic language of the quran this is a recent project with multiple layers of annotation including morphological segmentation partofspeech tagging and syntactic analysis using dependency grammar the digital corpus of sanskrit dcs is a sandhisplit corpus of sanskrit texts with full morphological and lexical analysis designed for texthistorical research in sanskrit linguistics and philology corpora from specific fields besides pure linguistic inquiry researchers had begun to apply corpus linguistics to other academic and professional fields such as the emerging subdiscipline of law and corpus linguistics which seeks to understand legal texts using corpus data and tools the dblp discovery dataset concentrates on computer science containing relevant computer science publications with sentient metadata such as author affiliations citations or study fields a more focused dataset was introduced by nlp scholar a combination of papers of the acl anthology and google scholar metadata corpora can also aid in translation efforts or in teaching foreign languages methods corpus linguistics has generated a number of research methods which attempt to trace a path from data to theory wallis and nelson  first introduced what they called the a perspective annotation abstraction and analysis annotation consists of the application of a scheme to texts annotations may include structural markup partofspeech tagging parsing and numerous other representations abstraction consists of the translation mapping of terms in the scheme to terms in a theoretically motivated model or dataset abstraction typically includes linguistdirected search but may include eg rulelearning for parsers analysis consists of statistically probing manipulating and generalising from the dataset analysis might include statistical evaluations optimisation of rulebases or knowledge discovery methods most lexical corpora today are partofspeechtagged postagged however even corpus linguists who work with unannotated plain text inevitably apply some method to isolate salient terms in such situations annotation and abstraction are combined in a lexical search the advantage of publishing an annotated corpus is that other users can then perform experiments on the corpus through corpus managers linguists with other interests and differing perspectives than the originators can exploit this work by sharing data corpus linguists are able to treat the corpus as a locus of linguistic debate and further study see also a linguistic atlas of early middle english collocation collostructional analysis concordance key word in context
