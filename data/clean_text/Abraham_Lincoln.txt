heavily on him for farmwork and for supplementary income hiring the boy out to area farmers and pocketing the money as was the custom at the time when he was somewhat older lincoln and some friends took a job carrying goods by flatboat to new orleans louisiana where the slave markets according to the historian michael burlingame would leave an indelible impression on him it was the first time

to illinois and settled in macon county abraham became increasingly distant from thomas in part due to his fathers lack of interest in education he would later refuse to attend his fathers deathbed or funeral in  marriage and children some historians such as michael burlingame identify lincolns first romantic interest as ann rutledge a young woman also from kentucky whom he met when he moved to new salem illinois lewis gannett however disputes that the evidence supports a romantic relationship between the two david herbert donald states that how that friendship between lincoln and rutledge developed into a romance cannot be reconstructed from the record rutledge died on august   of typhoid fever lincoln took her death very hard sinking into a serious depression and contemplating suicide

blacksmith but instead purchased a new salem general store in partnership with william berry because a license was required to sell customers alcoholic beverages berry obtained bartending licenses for lincoln and himself and in  the lincolnberry general store became a tavern as well burlingame wrote that berry was an undisciplined harddrinking fellow and lincoln was too softhearted to deny anyone credit although the economy was booming the business struggled and went into debt prompting lincoln to sell his share lincoln served as new salems postmaster and later as county surveyor but he continued his voracious reading and decided to become a lawyer rather than studying in the office of an established attorney as was customary lincoln read law on his own borrowing legal texts

a bill to abolish slavery in the district of columbia but dropped the bill when it failed to attract support from most other whigs lincoln spoke against the mexicanamerican war  for which he said president james k polk had some strong motive  to involve the two countries in a war and trusting to escape scrutiny by fixing the public gaze upon the exceeding brightness of military glorythat attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood he supported the wilmot proviso a failed  proposal to ban slavery in any us territory won from mexico polk insisted that mexican soldiers had begun the war by invading the territory of the state of texas  and shedding the blood of our citizens on our own soil in his  spot resolutions lincoln rhetorically demanded that polk tell congress the exact spot where this occurred but the polk administration did not respond his approach and rhetoric cost lincoln political support in his district and newspapers derisively nicknamed him spotty lincoln lincoln had pledged in  to serve only one term in the house realizing henry clay was unlikely to win the presidency he supported zachary taylor for the whig nomination in the  presidential election taylor won and lincoln hoped in vain to be appointed commissioner of the united states general land office the administration offered to appoint him secretary of the oregon territory instead this

from  to  one of his largest clients was the illinois central railroad which lincoln successfully sued to recover his legal fees lincoln represented william duff armstrong in his  trial for the murder of james preston metzker the case is famous for lincolns use of a fact established by judicial notice to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness after a witness testified to seeing the crime in the

grandson of peter cartwright lincolns political opponent harrison was charged with the murder of greek crafton who according to cartwright said as he lay dying that he had brought it upon myself and that he forgave harrison lincoln angrily protested the judges initial decision to exclude cartwrights claim as hearsay lincoln argued that the testimony involved a dying declaration and so was not subject to the hearsay rule instead of holding lincoln in contempt of court as expected the judge a democrat admitted the testimony into evidence resulting in harrisons acquittal republican politics  emergence as republican leader the compromise of  failed to alleviate tensions over slavery between the slaveholding south and the free north as the slavery debate in the nebraska and kansas territories became particularly acrimonious illinois senator stephen a douglas proposed popular sovereignty as a compromise the measure would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery the legislation alarmed many northerners who sought to prevent the spread of slavery but douglass kansasnebraska act narrowly passed congress in may  lincolns peoria speech of october  in which he declared his opposition to slavery was one of an estimated  speeches he delivered in the next six years on the topic of excluding slavery from the territories lincolns attacks on the kansasnebraska act marked his return to political life nationally the whigs were irreparably split by the kansasnebraska act and other ineffective efforts to compromise on the slavery issue reflecting on the demise of his party lincoln wrote in  i think i am a whig but others say there are no whigs and that i am an abolitionist i now do no more than oppose the extension of slavery the new republican party was formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery drawing from the antislavery wing of the whig party and combining free soil liberty and antislavery democratic party members lincoln resisted early republican entreaties fearing that the new party would become a platform for extreme abolitionists lincoln held out hope for rejuvenating the whigs though he lamented his partys growing closeness with the nativist know nothing movement in  lincoln was elected to the illinois legislature but before the term began he declined to take his seat so that he would be eligible to run in the upcoming us senate election at that time senators were elected by state legislatures after leading in the first six rounds of voting lincoln was unable to obtain a majority lincoln instructed his backers to vote for lyman trumbull an antislavery democrat who had received few votes in the earlier ballots lincolns decision to withdraw enabled his whig supporters and trumbulls antislavery democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream democratic candidate joel aldrich matteson  campaign violent political confrontations in kansas continued and opposition to the kansasnebraska act remained strong throughout the north as the  elections approached lincoln joined the republicans and attended the bloomington convention where the illinois republican party was established the convention platform endorsed congresss right to regulate slavery in the territories and backed the admission of kansas as a free state lincoln gave the final speech of the convention calling for the preservation of the union at the june  republican national convention lincoln received support to run as vice president but ultimately the party put forward a ticket of john c fremont and william dayton which lincoln supported throughout illinois the democrats nominated james buchanan and the know nothings nominated millard fillmore buchanan prevailed while republican william henry bissell won election as governor of illinois and lincoln became a leading republican in illinois dred scott v sandford dred scott was a slave whose master took him from a slave state to a territory that was free as a result of the missouri compromise after scott was returned to the slave state he petitioned a federal court for his freedom his petition was denied in dred scott v sandford  supreme court chief justice roger b taney wrote in his opinion that the missouri compromise was unconstitutional because it infringed on slave owners property rights by prohibiting them from bringing their slaves into the territories while many democrats hoped that dred scott would end the dispute over slavery in the territories the decision sparked further outrage in the north lincoln denounced it as the product of a conspiracy of democrats to support the slave power he argued that the decision was at variance with the declaration of independence which stated that all men are created equal  with certain unalienable rights among them life liberty and the pursuit of happiness lincolndouglas debates and cooper union speech in  douglas was up for reelection in the us senate and lincoln hoped to defeat him many in the party felt that a former whig should be nominated in  and lincolns  campaigning and support of trumbull had earned him a favor for the first time illinois republicans held a convention to agree upon a senate candidate and lincoln won the nomination with little opposition lincoln accepted the nomination with great enthusiasm and zeal after his nomination he delivered his house divided speech a house divided against itself cannot stand i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free i do not expect the union to be dissolvedi do not expect the house to fallbut i do expect it will cease to be divided it will become all one thing or all the other the speech created a stark image of the danger of disunion when informed of lincolns nomination douglas stated lincoln is the strong man of the party  and if i beat him my victory will be hardly won the senate campaign featured seven debates between lincoln and douglas they had an atmosphere akin to a prizefight and drew thousands lincoln warned that the slave power was threatening the values of republicanism and he accused douglas of distorting jeffersons premise that all men are created equal in his freeport doctrine douglas argued that despite the dred scott decision which he claimed to support local settlers under popular sovereignty should be free to choose whether to allow slavery in their territory he accused lincoln of having joined the abolitionists though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the democrats won more seats and the legislature reelected douglas however lincolns articulation of the issues had given him a national political presence in the aftermath of the  election newspapers frequently mentioned lincoln as a potential republican presidential candidate while lincoln was popular in the midwest he lacked support in the northeast and was unsure whether to seek the office in january  lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the presidential nomination if offered and in the following months william o stoddards central illinois gazette the chicago press  tribune and other local papers endorsed his candidacy on february   powerful new york republicans invited lincoln to give a speech at the cooper union in this address lincoln argued that the founding fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery he insisted that morality required opposition to slavery and rejected any groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong many in the audience thought he appeared awkward and even ugly but lincoln demonstrated intellectual leadership which brought him into contention for the presidency journalist noah brooks reported no man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a new york audience historian david herbert donald described the speech as a superb political move for an unannounced presidential aspirant in response to an inquiry about his ambitions lincoln said the taste is in my mouth a little  presidential election on may   the illinois republican state convention was held in decatur exploiting his embellished frontier legend of clearing land and splitting fence rails lincolns supporters promoted him as the rail candidate on may  at the republican national convention in chicago lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot a former democrat hannibal hamlin of maine was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket throughout the s lincoln had doubted the prospects of civil war and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession when douglas was selected as the candidate of the northern democrats delegates from the southern slave states elected incumbent vice president john c breckinridge as their candidate a group of former whigs and know nothings formed the constitutional union party and nominated john bell of tennessee lincoln and douglas competed for votes in the north while bell and breckinridge found support primarily in the south a nationwide militaristic republican youth organization the wide awakes turned it into one of the most excited elections in american history and triggered massive popular enthusiasm according to the political historian jon grinspan people of the northern states knew the southern states would vote against lincoln and rallied supporters for him as douglas and the other candidates campaigned lincoln gave no speeches relying on the enthusiasm of the republican party republican speakers emphasized lincolns childhood poverty to demonstrate the power of free labor which allowed a common farm boy to work his way to the top by his own efforts though he did not make public appearances many sought to visit and write to lincoln in the runup to the election he took an office in the illinois state capitol to deal with the influx of attention he also hired john george nicolay as his personal secretary who would remain in that role during the presidency on november   lincoln was elected as the first republican president his victory was entirely due to his support in the north and west no ballots were cast for him in  of the  southern slave states lincoln received  votes or  percent of the total in a fourway race carrying the free northern states as well as california and oregon and winning the electoral vote decisively presidency  first term secession and inauguration after lincolns election secessionists implemented plans to leave the union before he took office in march  on december   south carolina adopted an ordinance of secession by february   florida mississippi alabama georgia louisiana and texas had followed six of these states declared themselves to be a sovereign nation the confederate states of america selecting jefferson davis as its provisional president the upper south and border states delaware maryland virginia north carolina tennessee kentucky missouri and arkansas initially rejected the secessionist appeal president buchanan and presidentelect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy declaring secession illegal on february   lincoln gave a particularly emotional farewell address upon leaving springfield for washington lincoln and the republicans rejected the proposed crittenden compromise as contrary to the partys platform of freesoil in the territories lincoln said i will suffer death before i consent  to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right lincoln supported the corwin amendment to the us constitution which would have protected slavery in states where it already existed the amendment passed congress and was awaiting ratification by the required threefourths of the states when southern states began to secede on march   in his first inaugural address lincoln said that because he held such a provision to now be implied constitutional law i have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable due to secessionist plots careful attention was paid to lincolns security and to the train he took to washington the presidentelect evaded suspected assassins in baltimore he traveled in disguise wearing a soft felt hat instead of his customary stovepipe hat and draping an overcoat over his shoulders while hunching to conceal his height on february   he arrived in washington dc which was placed under military guard many in the opposition press criticized his secretive journey opposition newspapers mocked lincoln with caricatures showing him sneaking into the capital lincoln directed his inaugural address to the south proclaiming once again that he had no inclination to abolish slavery in the southern states apprehension seems to exist among the people of the southern states that by the accession of a republican administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered there has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension indeed the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection it is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you i do but quote from one of those speeches when i declare that i have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists i believe i have no lawful right to do so and i have no inclination to do so the president ended his address with an appeal to the people of the south we are not enemies but friends the mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone  will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched  by the better angels of our nature according to donald the failure of the peace conference of  to attract the attendance of seven of the confederate states signaled that legislative compromise was not a practical expectation personnel in selecting his cabinet lincoln chose the men he found the most competent even when they had been his opponents for the presidency lincoln commented on his thought process we need the strongest men of the party in the cabinet we needed to hold our own people together i had looked the party over and concluded that these were the very strongest men then i had no right to deprive the country of their services goodwin described the group in her biography of lincoln as a team of rivals lincoln named his main political opponent william h seward as secretary of state lincoln made five appointments to the supreme court noah haynes swayne a prominent corporate lawyer from ohio replaced john mclean after the latters death in april  like mclean swayne opposed slavery samuel freeman miller who replaced peter v daniel was an avowed abolitionist and received widespread support from iowa politicians david davis was lincolns campaign manager in  and had served as a judge in the illinois court circuit where lincoln practiced democrat stephen johnson field a previous california supreme court justice provided geographic and political balance finally after the death of roger b taney lincoln appointed his former secretary of the treasury salmon p chase to replace taney as chief justice lincoln believed chase was an able jurist who would support reconstruction legislation and that his appointment would unite the republican party commanderinchief in early april  major robert anderson commander of fort sumter in charleston south carolina advised that he was nearly out of food after considerable debate lincoln decided to send provisions according to michael burlingame he could not be sure that his decision would precipitate a war though he had good reason to believe that it might on april   confederate forces fired on union troops at fort sumter donald concludes his repeated efforts to avoid collision  showed that he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood but he had also vowed not to surrender the forts the only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot the april  and  attack on fort sumter rallied the northern public to see military action against the south as necessary to defend the nation on april  lincoln called for  militiamen to recapture forts protect washington and preserve the union this call forced states to choose whether to secede or to support the union north carolina virginia tennessee and arkansas seceded as the northern states sent regiments south on april  baltimore mobs in control of the rail links attacked union troops who were changing trains local leaders groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital and the army responded by arresting local maryland officials lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus allowing arrests without formal charges john merryman a maryland officer arrested for hindering us troop movements successfully petitioned supreme court chief justice taney to issue a writ of habeas corpus in an opinion titled ex parte merryman taney not ruling on behalf of the supreme court wrote that the constitution authorized only congress and not the president to suspend habeas corpus but lincoln engaged in nonacquiescence and persisted with the policy of suspension in select areas under various suspensions  civilians were detained without trial several including the antiwar democrat clement l vallandigham were tried in military courts for treasonable actions which was condemned as an attack on free speech early union military strategy lincoln took executive control of the war and shaped the union military strategy he responded to the unprecedented political and military crisis as commanderinchief by exercising unprecedented authority he expanded his war powers imposed a naval blockade on confederate ports disbursed funds before appropriation by congress suspended habeas corpus and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected confederate sympathizers lincoln gained the support of congress and the northern public for these actions lincoln also had to reinforce union sympathies in the border slave states and keep the war from becoming an international conflict it was clear from the outset that bipartisan support was essential to success and that any compromise alienated factions in both political parties copperheads antiwar democrats criticized lincoln for refusing to compromise on slavery the radical republicans who demanded harsh treatment against secession criticized him for moving too slowly to abolish slavery on august   lincoln signed the confiscation act which authorized judicial proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the confederates the law had little practical effect but it signaled political support for abolishing slavery lincolns war strategy had two priorities ensuring that washington was well defended and conducting an aggressive war effort for a prompt decisive victory twice a week lincoln met with his cabinet occasionally lincolns wife mary prevailed on him to take a carriage ride concerned that he was working too hard early in the war lincoln selected civilian generals from varied political and ethnic backgrounds to secure their and their constituents support for the war effort and ensure that the war became a national struggle in january  after complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the war department lincoln replaced simon cameron as war secretary with edwin stanton stanton worked more often and more closely with lincoln than did any other senior official according to stantons biographers benjamin thomas and harold hyman stanton and lincoln virtually conducted the war together lincoln saw the importance of vicksburg for control of the mississippi river valley and understood the necessity of defeating the enemys army rather than merely capturing territory in directing the unions war strategy lincoln valued the advice of winfield scott even after his retirement as commanding general of the united states army in  scott proposed the anaconda plan which relied on port blockades and advancing down the mississippi to subdue the south in june  lincoln made an unannounced visit to west point where he spent five hours consulting with scott regarding the handling of the war internationally lincoln wanted to forestall foreign military aid to the confederacy he relied on his combative secretary of state william seward while working closely with senate foreign relations committee chairman charles sumner in  the us navy illegally intercepted a british mail ship the rms trent on the high seas and seized two confederate envoys although the north celebrated the seizure britain protested vehemently and the trent affair threatened war between the americans and the british lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats mcclellan after the union rout at bull run and winfield scotts retirement lincoln appointed george b mcclellan generalinchief early in the war mcclellan created defenses for washington that were almost impregnable  forts and batteries with  guns manned by  artillerists he spent months planning his virginia peninsula campaign mcclellans slow progress and excessive precautions frustrated lincoln mcclellan in turn blamed the failure of the campaign on lincolns cautiousness in having reserved troops for the capital in  lincoln removed mcclellan as generalinchief he elevated henry halleck to the post and appointed john pope as head of the new army of virginia in the summer of  pope was soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run forcing him to retreat to washington soon after the army of virginia was disbanded despite his dissatisfaction with mcclellans failure to reinforce pope lincoln restored him to command of all forces around washington which included both the army of the potomac and the remains of the army of virginia two days later robert e lees forces crossed the potomac river into maryland leading to the battle of antietam this battle a union victory was among the bloodiest in american history a crisis of command occurred for lincoln when mcclellan then resisted the presidents demand that he pursue lees withdrawing army while don carlos buell likewise refused orders to move the army of the ohio against rebel forces in eastern tennessee lincoln replaced buell with william rosecrans and mcclellan with ambrose burnside according to donald this was a shrewd political move as they were nonpartisanunlike mcclellan a democrat against presidential advice burnside launched an offensive across the rappahannock river and was defeated by lee at fredericksburg in december facing low morale and discontent among the troops lincoln replaced burnside with joseph hooker hooker endured heavy casualties at the battle of chancellorsville in may then resigned in june and was replaced by george meade meade followed lee north into pennsylvania and defeated him in the gettysburg campaign but then failed to effectively block lees orderly retreat to virginia despite lincolns demands at the same time ulysses s grant captured vicksburg and gained control of the mississippi river in may  lincoln issued the lieber code which governed wartime conduct of the union army defining command responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity emancipation proclamation two union generals had issued emancipation orders in  and  but lincoln overrode both he found that the decision to emancipate was not within the generals power and that it might induce loyal border states to secede however in june  congress passed an act banning slavery in all federal territories which lincoln signed in july the confiscation act of  was enacted allowing the seizure of slaves from those disloyal to the united states on july   lincoln reviewed a draft of the emancipation proclamation with his cabinet senator willard saulsbury sr criticized the proclamation stating that it would light their author to dishonor through all future generations by contrast horace greeley editor of the newyork tribune in his public letter the prayer of twenty millions implored lincoln to embrace emancipation in a public letter of august   lincoln replied to greeley that while he personally wished all men could be free his first obligation as president was to preserve the union my paramount object in this struggle is to save the union and is not either to save or to destroy slavery if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do it and if i could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone i would also do that buttressed by news of the recent union victory at antietam on september   lincoln issued the preliminary emancipation proclamation on january   he issued the final version freeing the slaves in the ten states not then under union control exempting areas under such control lincoln commented on signing the proclamation i never in my life felt more certain that i was doing right than i do in signing this paper on new years eve in  black people  enslaved and free  gathered across the united states to hold watch night ceremonies for freedoms eve looking toward the promised fulfillment of the proclamation with the abolition of slavery in the rebel states now a military objective union armies advancing south enabled thousands to escape bondage the proclamation was immediately denounced by copperheads who advocated restoring the union by allowing slavery it was also seen as a betrayal of his promise to southern unionists not to tamper with slavery emerson etheridge then clerk of the house of representatives joined an unsuccessful plot to give the democrats and southern unionists control of the house as a result of the proclamation enlisting freedmen became official policy in a letter to tennessee military governor andrew johnson lincoln wrote the bare sight of fifty thousand armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the mississippi would end the rebellion at once gettysburg address  lincoln gave the dedication for the gettysburg battlefield cemetery on november   he asserted that the nation was conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal and that the deaths of the brave men  who struggled here would not be in vain but that the nation shall have a new birth of freedomand that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth the address became the most quoted speech in american history following admiral david farraguts capture of new orleans in  and after victories at gettysburg and vicksburg lincoln proclaimed a national thanksgiving holiday to be celebrated on the final thursday of november  promoting grant grants victories at the battle of shiloh and in the vicksburg campaign impressed lincoln responding to criticism of grant after shiloh lincoln said i cant spare this man he fights following meades failure to capture lees army after gettysburg and after grants success at chattanooga lincoln promoted grant to commander of all union armies lincoln reacted to union losses by mobilizing support throughout the north union forces targeted infrastructureplantations railroads and bridgesto weaken the souths morale and fighting ability while lincoln sanctioned this approach he emphasized the defeat of the confederate armies over destruction for its own sake grants bloody overland campaign turned into a strategic success for the union despite a number of setbacks but the campaign was the bloodiest in american history approximately  casualties on the union side including  deaths compared to about  on the confederate including  deaths lees losses although lower in absolute numbers were proportionately higher over  than grants about  in early april the confederate government evacuated richmond and lincoln visited the conquered capital amid the turmoil of military actions on june   lincoln signed into law the yosemite grant which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as yosemite national park according to rolf diamant and ethan carr the yosemite grant was a direct consequence of the war  an embodiment of the ongoing process of remaking government  an intentional assertion of a steadfast belief in the eventual union victory fiscal and monetary policy lincoln and secretary of the treasury salmon chase faced a challenge in funding a wartime economy congress quickly approved lincolns request to assemble an army even increasing his proposed  soldiers to  but both congress and chase initially resisted raising taxes after the union defeat at the first battle of bull run which collapsed the bond market congress passed the revenue act of  this act imposed the first us federal income tax creating a flat tax of three percent on annual incomes above   in current dollars the preference for taxation based on income rather than property reflected the increasing amount of wealth held in stocks and bonds for example representative schuyler colfax declared during the debate i cannot go home and tell my constituents that i voted for a bill that would allow a man a millionaire who has put his entire property into stock to be exempt from taxation while a farmer who lives by his side must pay a tax as the average urban worker made approximately  per year many were not required to pay income taxes lincoln also signed increases to the morrill tariff which had become law in the final months of buchanans tenure these tariffs raised import duties considerably and were designed both to increase revenue and to help manufacturers offset the burden of new taxes throughout the war congress debated whether to raise additional revenue primarily by increasing tariff rates which most strongly affected rural areas or by increasing income taxes which most affected wealthier individuals the latter view proved more popular the revenue measures of  proved inadequate for funding the war forcing congress to take further action in february  congress passed the legal tender act which authorized the minting of  million in greenbacksthe first banknotes issued by the us government since the end of the american revolution greenbacks were not backed by gold or silver but rather by the governments promise to honor their value by the end of the war  million worth of greenbacks were in circulation congress also passed the revenue act of  which established an excise tax affecting nearly every commodity as well as the first national inheritance tax it also added a progressive tax structure to the federal income tax to collect these taxes congress created the office of the commissioner of internal revenue despite the new revenue measures funding the war remained challenging the government continued to issue greenbacks and borrow large amounts of money and the us national debt grew from  million in  to over  billion in  the revenue act of  represented a compromise between those who favored a more progressive tax structure and those who favored a flat tax it established a fivepercent tax on incomes above  and a tenpercent tax on incomes above  and it raised taxes on businesses in early  congress reduced the threshold for tenpercent taxation to incomes above  by the end of the war the income tax constituted about onefifth of the federal governments revenue though it was intended as a temporary wartime measure lincoln also took action against wartime fraud signing into law the false claims act of  this statute imposed penalties for false claims and made it possible for private citizens to file falseclaim qui tam lawsuits on behalf of the us government and share in the recovery hoping to stabilize the currency lincoln convinced congress to pass the national banking act in  established the office of the comptroller of the currency to oversee national banks which were subject to federal rather than state regulation in return for investing a third of their capital in federal bonds national banks were authorized to issue federal banknotes after congress imposed a tax on private banknotes in march  federal banknotes became the dominant form of paper currency other economic policies passed under lincoln included the  homestead act which made millions of acres of governmentheld land in the west available for purchase at low cost the  morrill landgrant colleges act provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state the pacific railway acts of  and  granted federal support for the construction of the united states first transcontinental railroad which was completed in  foreign policy at the start of the war russia was the lone great power to support the union while the other european powers had varying degrees of sympathy for the confederacy according to the historian dean mahin lincoln had limited familiarity with diplomatic practices but exerted substantial influence on us diplomacy as the union attempted to avoid war with britain and france lincoln appointed diplomats to try to persuade european nations not to recognize the confederacy lincolns policy succeeded all foreign nations were officially neutral throughout the civil war with none recognizing the confederacy some european leaders looked for ways to exploit the inability of the us to enforce the monroe doctrine opposing european colonial intervention in the americas spain invaded the dominican republic in  while france established a puppet regime in mexico however many in europe also hoped for a quick end to the war both for humanitarian reasons and because of the economic disruption it caused the european aristocracy was absolutely gleeful in pronouncing the american debacle as proof that the entire experiment in popular government had failed according to don h doyle union diplomats initially had to explain that the united states was not committed to ending slavery and instead they argued that secession was unconstitutional confederate spokesmen on the other hand were more successful by ignoring slavery and instead focusing on their struggle for independence their commitment to free trade and the essential role of cotton in the european economy however the confederacys hope that cotton exports would compel european interference did not come to fruition as britain found alternative sources and maintained economic ties with the union though the issuance of the emancipation proclamation in january  did not immediately end the possibility of european intervention it rallied european public opinion to the union by adding abolition as a union war goal any chance of a european intervention in the war ended with the union victories at gettysburg and vicksburg in july  as european leaders came to believe that the confederate cause was doomed native americans lincoln appointed william p dole as commissioner of the bureau of indian affairs and made extensive use of indian service positions to reward political supporters according to the historian thomas britten lincolns policies largely focused on assimilation of native americans and diminishing tribal landholdings consistent with those of his predecessors but his direct involvement in native american affairs was unclear his administration faced difficulties guarding western settlers railroads and telegraph lines from native american attacks tensions arose with the dakota people due to american treaty violations unfair trading and government practices that led to starvation in august  the dakota war broke out in minnesota hundreds of settlers were killed and  were displaced from their homes some feared incorrectly that it might represent a confederate conspiracy to start a war on the northwestern frontier lincoln ordered thousands of paroled prisoners of war be sent to put down the uprising when the confederacy protested lincoln revoked the policy and none arrived in minnesota lincoln sent pope as commander of the new department of the northwest appointed as a state militia colonel henry hastings sibley eventually defeated the dakota chief little crow at the battle of wood lake a war crimes trial led by sibley sentenced  dakota warriors to death the legal scholar carol chomsky described the trial as a study in military injustice designed to guarantee an unjust outcome lincoln pardoned all but  of the condemned warriors and with one execution suspended the remaining  were hanged in the largest mass execution in us history congressman alexander ramsey told lincoln in  that he would have received more reelection support in minnesota had he executed all  warriors lincoln responded i could not afford to hang men for votes lincoln called for reform of federal indian policy but prioritized the war and reconstruction changes were made in response to the sand creek massacre of november  prioritizing peaceful administration of native affairs and condemning those encroaching on native territory but not until after lincolns death second term reelection lincoln ran for reelection in  the democratic nominee was former general mcclellan the republican party selected andrew johnson a war democrat as lincolns running mate to broaden his coalition to include war democrats as well as republicans lincoln ran under the label of the new national union party grants bloody stalemates and confederate victories such as the battle of the crater damaged lincolns reelection prospects and many republicans feared defeat lincoln prepared a confidential memorandum pledging that if he should lose the election he would cooperate with the presidentelect as to save the union between the election and the inauguration as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterwards victories at atlanta in september and in the shenandoah valley in october turned public opinion and lincoln was reelected with  percent of the popular vote as well as  electoral votes to mcclellans  as grant continued to weaken lees forces efforts to discuss peace began on february   alexander h stephens the confederate vice president and two other confederate officials met with lincoln and seward at hampton roads lincoln refused to negotiate with the confederacy as a coequal and the only agreement reached at the meeting concerned the exchange of prisoners on march   lincoln delivered his second inaugural address historian mark noll places the speech among the small handful of semisacred texts by which americans conceive their place in the world it is inscribed in the lincoln memorial lincoln closed his speech with these words with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nations wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphanto do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations a month later on april  lee surrendered to grant at appomattox signaling the end of the war it triggered a series of subsequent surrenders across the southin north carolina alabama and the transmississippi theaterand finally at sea with the surrender of the css shenandoah in november  reconstruction reconstruction began before the wars end as lincoln and his associates considered the reintegration of the nation and the fates of confederate leaders and freed slaves when a general asked lincoln how the defeated confederates were to be treated lincoln replied let em up easy he focused not on blame for the war but on rebuilding determined to reunite the nation and not alienate the south lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held his amnesty proclamation of december   offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office and had not mistreated union prisoners if they signed an oath of allegiance lincoln led the moderates in reconstruction policy and was opposed by the radicals under thaddeus stevens charles sumner and benjamin wade who otherwise remained lincolns allies as southern states fell they needed leaders while their administrations were being restored in tennessee and arkansas lincoln appointed andrew johnson and frederick steele respectively as military governors in louisiana lincoln ordered nathaniel p banks to promote a plan that would reestablish statehood when  percent of the voters agreed but only if the reconstructed states abolished slavery democratic opponents accused lincoln of using the plan to ensure his and the republicans political aspirations the radicals denounced his policy as too lenient and passed their own plan the  wadedavis bill but lincoln pocketvetoed it the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat elected representatives from louisiana arkansas and tennessee after implementing the emancipation proclamation lincoln increased pressure on congress to outlaw slavery nationwide with a constitutional amendment by december  an amendment was brought to congress the senate passed it on april   but the first vote in the house of representatives fell short of the required twothirds majority passage became part of lincolns reelection platform and after his reelection the second attempt in the house passed on january   after ratification by threefourths of the states in december  it became the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution abolishing slavery and involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime lincoln announced a reconstruction plan that involved shortterm military administration pending readmission under the control of southern unionists he also signed senator charles sumners freedmens bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate needs of former slaves the law opened land for a lease of three years with the ability for the freedmen to purchase title in signing it according to the historian richard carwardine lincoln acknowledged that the government had at least some responsibility for the material needs of millions of exslaves although it fell short of the forty acres and a mule that many slaves understood they would receive from confiscated property eric foner argues that lincoln did not see reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation he had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land however the lincoln scholar phillip s paludan suggests that at the end of his life lincoln was moving towards a more radical position particularly with regards to freedmens rights foner adds that had lincoln lived into the reconstruction era it is entirely plausible to imagine lincoln and congress agreeing on a reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage along the lines lincoln proposed just before his death assassination john wilkes booth was a wellknown actor and a confederate spy from maryland though he never joined the confederate army he had contacts within the confederate secret service after attending lincolns last public address on april   in which lincoln stated his preference that the franchise be conferred on some black men specifically on the very intelligent and on those who serve our cause as soldiers booth plotted to assassinate the president when booth learned of the lincolns intent to attend a play with grant he planned to assassinate lincoln and grant at fords theatre lincoln and his wife attended the play our american cousin on the evening of april  at the last minute grant decided to go to new jersey to visit his children instead of attending at  pm booth entered lincolns theater box crept up from behind and fired at the back of lincolns head mortally wounding him lincolns guest major henry rathbone momentarily grappled with booth but booth stabbed him and escaped after being attended by charles leale and two other doctors lincoln was taken across the street to petersen house he remained in a coma for nine hours and died at  am on april  lincolns body was wrapped in a flag and placed in a coffin which was loaded into a hearse and escorted to the white house by union soldiers johnson was sworn in as president later that day two weeks later booth was located shot and killed at a farm in virginia by sergeant boston corbett funeral and burial from april  to  lincoln lay in state first in the white house and then in the capitol rotunda the caskets containing lincolns body and the body of his third son willie then traveled for two weeks on a funeral train following a circuitous route from washington dc to springfield illinois stopping at several cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands many others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with bands bonfires and hymn singing or in silent grief historians emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow but noted that some who had hated lincoln celebrated his death walt whitman composed four elegies to lincoln including when lilacs last in the dooryard bloomd and o captain my captain lincolns body was buried at oak ridge cemetery in springfield and now lies within the lincoln tomb philosophy and views lincoln redefined the political philosophy of republicanism in the united states because the declaration of independence says that all men have an unalienable right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness he called it the sheet anchor of republicanism at a time when the constitution was the focus of most political discourse he presented the declaration as establishing equality as a foundational principle for the united states which had a significant impact on social and political movements in the us into the th century as a whig activist lincoln was a spokesman for business interests favoring high tariffs banks infrastructure improvements and railroads in opposition to jacksonian democrats nevertheless lincoln admired andrew jacksons steeliness and patriotism and adopted the jacksonian belief in the common man according to historian sean wilentz just as the republican party of the s absorbed certain elements of jacksonianism so lincoln whose whiggery had always been more egalitarian than that of other whigs found himself absorbing some of them as well william c harris found that lincolns reverence for the founding fathers the constitution the laws under it and the preservation of the republic and its institutions strengthened his conservatism in lincolns first inaugural address he denounced secession as anarchy and argued that a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments is the only true sovereign of a free people religious skepticism and providence as a young man lincoln was a religious skeptic however he was deeply familiar with the bible throughout his public career he often quoted scripture his three most famous speechesthe house divided speech the gettysburg address and his second inaugural addressall contain such quotes in the s lincoln subscribed to the doctrine of necessity a belief that the human mind was controlled by a higher power after the death of his son edward in  lincoln more frequently expressed a dependence on god he never joined a church although he and his wife frequently attended first presbyterian church in springfield illinois beginning in  while president lincoln often attended services at the new york avenue presbyterian church in washington dc the death of his son willie in february  may have caused him to look toward religion for solace lincolns frequent use of religious imagery and language toward the end of his life may have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to reach his audiences who were mostly evangelical protestants sources differ in how they describe his religious beliefs his law partner william herndon gave a lecture after lincolns death stating that he was an unbeliever james smith the pastor of first presbyterian church in springfield responded to this lecture with an open letter asserting that lincoln did avow his belief in the divine authority and the inspiration of the scriptures stephen mansfield describes an atheist or religiously skeptical lincoln as the prevailing view although he argues that there was a spiritual journey of some kind in abraham lincolns life richard carwardine writes that many elements of the inner lincoln including his personal faith  necessarily remain a puzzle lincolns last words were as reported by his wife there is no place i so much desire to see as jerusalem health and appearance according to michael burlingame lincoln was described as awkward and gawky as a youth in adolescence he was tall and strong participating in jumping throwing wrestling and footraces and demonstrating exceptional strength burlingame notes that lincolns clothes were typically rough and suited to the frontier with a gap between his shoes socks and pants that often exposed six or more inches of his shin he cared little about fashion lincoln was a slender six feet four inches with a highpitched voice while he is usually portrayed bearded he did not grow a beard until  at the suggestion of yearold grace bedell he was the first us president to do so william h herndon described lincolns face as long narrow sallow and cadaverous his cheeks as leathery and saffroncolored lincoln described himself as having a dark complexion with coarse black hair lincolns detractors also remarked on his appearance for example the charleston mercury described him as having the dirtiest complexion and asked faugh after him what decent white man would be president among the illnesses that lincoln is either documented or speculated to have suffered from are depression smallpox and malaria he took blue mass pills which contained mercury to treat melancholy or hypochondriasis this may have resulted in mercury poisoning several claims have been made that lincolns health was declining before the assassination as photographs of lincoln appear to show weight loss and facial changes it has been proposed that he could have had a rare genetic disorder such as marfan syndrome or multiple endocrine neoplasia type b legacy historical reputation in surveys of us scholars ranking presidents since  the top three presidents are generally lincoln george washington and franklin delano roosevelt although the order varies a  study found that scholars in history and politics ranked lincoln number one while legal scholars placed him second after washington between  and  lincoln john f kennedy and ronald reagan were the topranked presidents in eight public opinion surveys by gallup lincolns assassination made him a national martyr he was viewed by abolitionists as a champion of human liberty many though not all in the south considered lincoln to be a man of outstanding ability in the new deal era liberals honored lincoln as an advocate of the common man who they claimed would have supported the welfare state and lincoln became a favorite of liberal intellectuals across the world the sociologist barry schwartz argues that in the s and s lincoln provided the nation with a moral symbol inspiring and guiding american life schwartz states that lincolns american reputation grew slowly from the late th century until the progressive era s when he emerged as one of americas most venerated heroes even among white southerners the high point came in  with the dedication of the lincoln memorial on the national mall in washington dc however schwartz also argued in  that since world war ii lincolns symbolic power has lost relevance and this fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness by the s lincoln had become a hero to political conservativesapart from neoconfederates such as mel bradford who denounced his treatment of the white southfor his nationalism his support for business his insistence on stopping the spread of slavery and his perceived devotion to the principles of the founding fathers the black orator and former slave frederick douglass stated that in his company i was never reminded of my humble origin or of my unpopular color and lincoln has long been known as the great emancipator by the late s however some black intellectuals denied that lincoln deserved that title lerone bennett jr won wide attention when he called lincoln a white supremacist in  he noted that lincoln used ethnic slurs and argued that lincoln opposed social equality and proposed that freed slaves voluntarily move to another country defenders of lincoln highlighted his condemnation of slavery and his contributions to its abolition casting his delays and racist rhetoric as concessions to political necessity rather than reflections of his personal beliefs lincoln has also been characterized as a folk hero and as honest abe david herbert donald opined in his  biography that lincoln was endowed with the personality trait of negative capability attributed to extraordinary leaders who were capable of being in uncertainties  without any irritable reaching after fact and reason lincoln has often been portrayed by hollywood almost always in a flattering light the film historian melvyn stokes writes that moviemakers have commonly used lincoln primarily as a metaphor for ideas and values they approved lincoln has also been admired by political figures outside the us including the german political theorist karl marx and giuseppe garibaldi leader of the italian risorgimento and later indian independence leader mahatma gandhi german politician willy brandt and nelson mandela who likened the new birth of freedom lincoln referenced in the gettysburg address to the end of apartheid in south africa memorials and commemorations lincolns portrait appears on two denominations of united states currency the penny and the  bill he appears on postage stamps across the world including in ghana honduras china haiti nicaragua colombia and argentina he has been memorialized in many town city and county names including the capital of nebraska the
