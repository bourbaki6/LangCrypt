world war ii or the second world war  september    september  was a global conflict between two coalitions the allies and the axis powers nearly all of the worlds countries participated with many nations mobilising their resources in pursuit of total war tanks and aircraft played major roles enabling the strategic bombing of cities and delivery of the first and only nuclear weapons ever used in war world war ii is the deadliest conflict in history causing the death of over  million people millions died in genocides including the holocaust and by massacres starvation and disease after the allied victory germany austria japan and korea were occupied and german and japanese leaders were put on trial for war crimes the causes of world war ii included unresolved tensions in the aftermath of world war i and the rise of fascism in europe and militarism in japan key events preceding the war included japans invasion of manchuria in  the spanish civil war the outbreak of the second sinojapanese war in  and germanys annexations of austria and the sudetenland world war ii is generally considered to have begun on  september  when nazi germany under adolf hitler invaded poland after which the united kingdom and france declared war on germany poland was also invaded by the soviet union in midseptember and was partitioned between germany and the soviet union under the molotovribbentrop pact in  the soviet union annexed the baltic states and parts of finland and romania while germany conquered norway belgium luxembourg and the netherlands after the fall of france in june  the war continued mainly between germany now assisted by fascist italy and the british empirebritish commonwealth with fighting in the balkans mediterranean and middle east east africa the aerial battle of britain and the blitz and the naval battle of the atlantic by mid yugoslavia and greece had also been defeated by axis countries in june  germany invaded the soviet union opening the eastern front and initially making large territorial gains along with axis allies in december  japan attacked american and british territories in asia and the pacific including pearl harbor in hawaii leading the united states to enter the war against the axis japan conquered much of coastal china and southeast asia but its advances in the pacific were halted in june  at the battle of midway in early  axis forces were defeated in north africa and at stalingrad in the soviet union an allied invasion of italy in july resulted in the fall of its fascist regime and allied offensives in the pacific and the soviet union forced the axis to retreat on all fronts in  the western allies invaded france at normandy and the soviet union advanced into central europe during the same period japan suffered major setbacks including the crippling of its navy by the united states the loss of key western pacific islands and defeats in southcentral china and burma the war in europe concluded with the liberation of germanoccupied territories and the invasion of germany by the allies which culminated in the fall of berlin to soviet troops and germanys unconditional surrender on  may  on  and  august the us dropped atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki in japan faced with an imminent allied invasion the prospect of further atomic bombings and a soviet declaration of war and invasion of manchuria japan announced its unconditional surrender on  august and signed a surrender document on  september  world war ii transformed the political economic and social structures of the world and established the foundation of international relations for the rest of the th century and into the st century the united nations was created to foster international cooperation and prevent future conflicts with the victorious great powerschina france the soviet union the uk and the usbecoming the permanent members of its security council the soviet union and the us emerged as rival superpowers setting the stage for the halfcentury cold war in the wake of europes devastation the influence of its great powers waned triggering the decolonisation of africa and of asia many countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion start and end dates most historians agree that world war ii began with the german invasion of poland on  september  and the united kingdom and frances declaration of war on germany two days later dates for the beginning of the pacific war include the start of the second sinojapanese war on  july  or the earlier japanese invasion of manchuria on  september  other proposed starting dates for world war ii include the italian invasion of abyssinia on  october  the british historian antony beevor views the beginning of world war ii as the battles of khalkhin gol fought between japan and the forces of mongolia and the soviet union from may to september  others view the spanish civil war as the start or prelude to world war ii the exact date of the wars end is also not universally agreed upon it was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the armistice of  august  vj day rather than with the formal surrender of japan on  september  which officially ended the war in asia a peace treaty between japan and the allies was signed in  a  treaty regarding germanys future allowed the reunification of east and west germany to take place no formal peace treaty between japan and the soviet union was ever signed although the state of war between the two countries was terminated by the sovietjapanese joint declaration of  which also restored full diplomatic relations between them background aftermath of world war i world war i had radically altered the political european map with the defeat of the central powersincluding austriahungary germany bulgaria and the ottoman empireand the  bolshevik seizure of power in russia which led to the founding of the soviet union meanwhile the victorious allies of world war i such as france belgium italy romania and greece gained territory and new nationstates were created out of the dissolution of the austrohungarian ottoman and russian empires to prevent a future world war the league of nations was established in  by the paris peace conference the organisations primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through collective security military and naval disarmament as well as settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration despite strong pacifist sentiment after world war i irredentist and revanchist nationalism had emerged in several european states these sentiments were especially pronounced in germany due to the significant territorial colonial and financial losses imposed by the treaty of versailles under the treaty germany lost around  percent of its home territory and all its overseas possessions while german annexation of other states was prohibited reparations were imposed and limits were placed on the size and capability of the countrys armed forces germany and italy the german empire was dissolved in the german revolution of  and a democratic government later known as the weimar republic was created the interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the political right and left italy as an entente ally had made some postwar territorial gains however italian nationalists were angered that the promises made by the united kingdom and france to secure italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement from  to  the fascist movement led by benito mussolini seized power in italy with a nationalist totalitarian and class collaborationist agenda that abolished representative democracy repressed socialist leftwing and liberal forces and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making italy a world power promising the creation of a new roman empire adolf hitler after an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the german government in  eventually became the chancellor of germany in  when president paul von hindenburg and the reichstag appointed him following hindenburgs death in  hitler proclaimed himself fuhrer of germany and abolished democracy espousing a radical racially motivated revision of the world order and soon began a massive rearmament campaign france seeking to secure its alliance with italy allowed italy a free hand in ethiopia which italy desired as a colonial possession the situation was aggravated in early  when the territory of the saar basin was legally reunited with germany and hitler repudiated the treaty of versailles accelerated his rearmament programme and introduced conscription european treaties the united kingdom france and italy formed the stresa front in april  in order to contain germany a key step towards military globalisation however that june the united kingdom made an independent naval agreement with germany easing prior restrictions the soviet union concerned by germanys goals of capturing vast areas of eastern europe drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with france before taking effect though the francosoviet pact was required to go through the bureaucracy of the league of nations which rendered it essentially toothless the united states concerned with events in europe and asia passed the neutrality act in august of the same year hitler defied the versailles and locarno treaties by remilitarising the rhineland in march  encountering little opposition due to the policy of appeasement in october  germany and italy formed the romeberlin axis a month later germany and japan signed the anticomintern pact which italy joined the following year asia the kuomintang party in china launched a unification campaign against regional warlords and nominally unified china in the mids but was soon embroiled in a civil war against its former chinese communist party ccp allies and new regional warlords in  an increasingly militaristic empire of japan which had long sought influence in china as the first step of what its government saw as the countrys right to rule asia staged the mukden incident as a pretext to invade manchuria and establish the puppet state of manchukuo china appealed to the league of nations to stop the japanese invasion of manchuria japan withdrew from the league of nations after being condemned for its incursion into manchuria the two nations then fought several battles in shanghai rehe and hebei until the tanggu truce was signed in  thereafter chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to japanese aggression in manchuria and chahar and suiyuan after the  xian incident the kuomintang and ccp forces agreed on a ceasefire to present a united front to oppose japan prewar events italian invasion of ethiopia  the second italoethiopian war was a colonial war that began in october  and ended in may  the war began with the invasion of the ethiopian empire also known as abyssinia by the armed forces of the kingdom of italy regno ditalia which was launched from italian somaliland and eritrea the war resulted in the military occupation of ethiopia and its annexation into the newly created colony of italian east africa africa orientale italiana in addition it exposed the weakness of the league of nations as a force to preserve peace both italy and ethiopia were member nations but the league did little when the former clearly violated article x of the leagues covenant the united kingdom and france supported imposing sanctions on italy for the invasion but the sanctions were not fully enforced and failed to end the italian invasion italy subsequently dropped its objections to germanys goal of absorbing austria spanish civil war  when civil war broke out in spain hitler and mussolini lent military support to the nationalist rebels led by general francisco franco italy supported the nationalists to a greater extent than the nazis mussolini sent more than  ground troops  aviation personnel and  aircraft to spain the soviet union supported the existing government of the spanish republic more than  foreign volunteers known as the international brigades also fought against the nationalists both germany and the soviet union used this proxy war as an opportunity to test in combat their most advanced weapons and tactics the nationalists won the civil war in april  franco now dictator remained officially neutral during world war ii but generally favoured the axis his greatest collaboration with germany was the sending of volunteers to fight on the eastern front japanese invasion of china  in july  japan captured the former chinese imperial capital of peking after instigating the marco polo bridge incident which culminated in the japanese campaign to invade all of china following years of tension and lowlevel conflicts the soviets quickly signed a nonaggression pact with china to lend materiel support effectively ending chinas prior cooperation with germany from september to november the japanese attacked taiyuan engaged the kuomintang army around xinkou fought communist forces in pingxingguan and wrestled control over chinas northern railway network nationalist generalissimo chiang kaishek deployed his best army to defend shanghai but after three months of heavy fighting shanghai fell the japanese continued to push chinese forces back capturing the capital nanking in december  in march  nationalist chinese forces won their first major victory at taierzhuang but ultimately lost control of the city of xuzhou in may in june  chinese forces stalled the japanese advance by flooding the yellow river buying time for the chinese to prepare their defences at wuhan at heavy cost to the local civilian population but the city was taken by october after heavy fighting along the yangtze river japanese military victories did not destroy chinese resistance instead the chinese government relocated inland to chongqing and continued the war aiming to break chinese morale japanese aircraft began striking cities in the sichuan basin in a bombing campaign killing tens of thousands of civilians sovietjapanese border conflicts in the midtolate s japanese forces in manchukuo had sporadic border clashes with the soviet union and mongolia the japanese doctrine of hokushinron which emphasised japans expansion northward was favoured by the imperial army during this time this policy would prove difficult to maintain in light of the japanese defeat at khalkin gol in  the ongoing second sinojapanese war and ally nazi germany pursuing neutrality with the soviets japan and the soviet union eventually signed a neutrality pact in april  and japan adopted the doctrine of nanshinron promoted by the navy which took its focus southward and eventually led to war with the united states and the western allies european occupations and agreements in europe germany and italy were becoming more aggressive in march  germany annexed austria again provoking little response from other european powers encouraged hitler began pressing german claims on the sudetenland an area of czechoslovakia with a predominantly ethnic german population soon the united kingdom and france followed the appeasement policy of british prime minister neville chamberlain and conceded this territory to germany in the munich agreement which was made against the wishes of the czechoslovak government in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands soon afterwards germany and italy forced czechoslovakia to cede additional territory to hungary and poland annexed the transolza region of czechoslovakia although all of germanys stated demands had been satisfied by the agreement privately hitler was furious that british interference had prevented him from seizing all of czechoslovakia in one operation in subsequent speeches hitler attacked british and jewish warmongers and in january  secretly ordered a major buildup of the german navy to challenge british naval supremacy in march  germany invaded the remainder of czechoslovakia and subsequently split it into the german protectorate of bohemia and moravia and a progerman client state the slovak republic hitler also delivered an ultimatum to lithuania on  march  forcing the concession of the klaipeda region formerly the german memelland greatly alarmed and with hitler making further demands on the free city of danzig the united kingdom and france guaranteed their support for polish independence when italy conquered albania in april  the same guarantee was extended to the kingdoms of romania and greece shortly after the francobritish pledge to poland germany and italy formalised their own alliance with the pact of steel hitler accused the united kingdom and poland of trying to encircle germany and renounced the anglogerman naval agreement and the germanpolish declaration of nonaggression the situation became a crisis in late august as german troops continued to mobilise against the polish border on  august the soviet union signed a nonaggression pact with germany after tripartite negotiations for a military alliance between france the united kingdom and soviet union had stalled this pact had a secret protocol that defined german and soviet spheres of influence western poland and lithuania for germany eastern poland finland estonia latvia and bessarabia for the soviet union and raised the question of continuing polish independence the pact neutralised the possibility of soviet opposition to a campaign against poland and assured that germany would not have to face the prospect of a twofront war as it had in world war i immediately afterwards hitler ordered the attack to proceed on  august but upon hearing that the united kingdom had concluded a formal mutual assistance pact with poland and that italy would maintain neutrality he decided to delay it in response to british requests for direct negotiations to avoid war germany made demands on poland which served as a pretext to worsen relations on  august hitler demanded that a polish plenipotentiary immediately travel to berlin to negotiate the handover of danzig and to allow a plebiscite in the polish corridor in which the german minority would vote on secession the poles refused to comply with the german demands and on the night of  august in a confrontational meeting with the british ambassador nevile henderson ribbentrop declared that germany considered its claims rejected course of the war war breaks out in europe  on  september  germany invaded poland after having staged several false flag border incidents as a pretext to initiate the invasion the first german attack of the war came against the polish defences at westerplatte the united kingdom responded with an ultimatum for germany to cease military operations and on  september after the ultimatum was ignored britain and france declared war on germany during the phoney war period the alliance provided no direct military support to poland outside of a cautious french probe into the saarland the western allies also began a naval blockade of germany which aimed to damage the countrys economy and war effort germany responded by ordering uboat warfare against allied merchant and warships which would later escalate into the battle of the atlantic on  september german troops reached the suburbs of warsaw the polish counteroffensive to the west halted the german advance for several days but it was outflanked and encircled by the wehrmacht remnants of the polish army broke through to besieged warsaw on  september  two days after signing a ceasefire with japan the soviet union invaded poland under the supposed pretext that the polish state had ceased to exist on  september the warsaw garrison surrendered to the germans and the last large operational unit of the polish army surrendered on  october despite the military defeat poland never surrendered instead it formed the polish governmentinexile and a clandestine state apparatus remained in occupied poland a significant part of polish military personnel evacuated to romania and latvia many of them later fought against the axis in other theatres of the war germany annexed western poland and occupied central poland the soviet union annexed eastern poland small shares of polish territory were transferred to lithuania and slovakia on  october hitler made a public peace overture to the united kingdom and france but said that the future of poland was to be determined exclusively by germany and the soviet union the proposal was rejected and hitler ordered an immediate offensive against france which was postponed until the spring of  due to bad weather after the outbreak of war in poland stalin threatened estonia latvia and lithuania with military invasion forcing the three baltic countries to sign pacts allowing the creation of soviet military bases in these countries in october  significant soviet military contingents were moved there finland refused to sign a similar pact and rejected ceding part of its territory to the soviet union the soviet union invaded finland in november  and was subsequently expelled from the league of nations for this crime of aggression despite overwhelming numerical superiority soviet military success during the winter war was modest and the finnosoviet war ended in march  with some finnish concessions of territory in june  the soviet union occupied the entire territories of estonia latvia and lithuania as well as the romanian regions of bessarabia northern bukovina and the hertsa region in august  hitler imposed the second vienna award on romania which led to the transfer of northern transylvania to hungary in september  bulgaria demanded southern dobruja from romania with german and italian support leading to the treaty of craiova the loss of onethird of romanias  territory caused a coup against king carol ii turning romania into a fascist dictatorship under marshal ion antonescu with a course set towards the axis in the hopes of a german guarantee meanwhile germansoviet political relations and economic cooperation gradually stalled and both states began preparations for war western europe  in april  germany invaded denmark and norway to protect shipments of iron ore from sweden which the allies were attempting to cut off denmark capitulated after six hours and despite allied support norway was conquered within two months british discontent over the norwegian campaign led to the resignation of prime minister neville chamberlain who was replaced by winston churchill on  may  on the same day germany launched an offensive against france to circumvent the strong maginot line fortifications on the francogerman border germany directed its attack at the neutral nations of belgium the netherlands and luxembourg the germans carried out a flanking manoeuvre through the ardennes region which was mistakenly perceived by the allies as an impenetrable natural barrier against armoured vehicles by successfully implementing new blitzkrieg tactics the wehrmacht rapidly advanced to the channel and cut off the allied forces in belgium trapping the bulk of the allied armies in a cauldron on the francobelgian border near lille the united kingdom was able to evacuate a significant number of allied troops from the continent by early june although they had to abandon almost all their equipment on  june italy invaded france declaring war on both france and the united kingdom the germans turned south against the weakened french army and paris fell to them on  june eight days later france signed an armistice with germany it was divided into german and italian occupation zones and an unoccupied rump state under the vichy regime which though officially neutral was generally aligned with germany france kept its fleet which the united kingdom attacked on  july in an attempt to prevent its seizure by germany the air battle of britain began in early july with luftwaffe attacks on shipping and harbours the german campaign for air superiority started in august but its failure to defeat raf fighter command forced the indefinite postponement of the proposed german invasion of britain the german strategic bombing offensive intensified with night attacks on london and other cities in the blitz but largely ended in may  after failing to significantly disrupt the british war effort using newly captured french ports the german navy enjoyed success against an overextended royal navy using uboats against british shipping in the atlantic the british home fleet scored a significant victory on  may  by sinking the german battleship bismarck in november  the united states was assisting china and the western allies and had amended the neutrality act to allow cash and carry purchases by the allies in  following the german capture of paris the size of the united states navy was significantly increased in september the united states further agreed to a trade of american destroyers for british bases still a large majority of the american public continued to oppose any direct military intervention in the conflict well into  in december  president franklin d roosevelt accused hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out any negotiations as useless calling for the united states to become an arsenal of democracy and promoting lendlease programmes of military and humanitarian aid to support the british war effort lendlease was later extended to the other allies including the soviet union after it was invaded by germany the united states started strategic planning to prepare for a fullscale offensive against germany at the end of september  the tripartite pact formally united japan italy and germany as the axis powers the tripartite pact stipulated that any countrywith the exception of the soviet unionthat attacked any axis power would be forced to go to war against all three the axis expanded in november  when hungary slovakia and romania joined romania and hungary later made major contributions to the axis war against the soviet union in romanias case partially to recapture territory ceded to the soviet union mediterranean  in early june  the italian regia aeronautica attacked and besieged malta a british possession from late summer to early autumn italy conquered british somaliland and made an incursion into britishheld egypt in october italy attacked greece but the attack was repulsed with heavy italian casualties the campaign ended within months with minor territorial changes to assist italy and prevent britain from gaining a foothold germany prepared to invade the balkans which would threaten romanian oil fields and strike against british dominance of the mediterranean in december  british empire forces began counteroffensives against italian forces in egypt and italian east africa the offensives were successful by early february  italy had lost control of eastern libya and large numbers of italian troops had been taken prisoner the italian navy also suffered significant defeats with the royal navy putting three italian battleships out of commission after a carrier attack at taranto and neutralising several more warships at the battle of cape matapan italian defeats prompted germany to deploy an expeditionary force to north africa at the end of march  erwin rommels afrika korps launched an offensive which drove back commonwealth forces in less than a month axis forces advanced to western egypt and besieged the port of tobruk by late march  bulgaria and yugoslavia signed the tripartite pact however the yugoslav government was overthrown two days later by probritish nationalists germany and italy responded with simultaneous invasions of both yugoslavia and greece commencing on  april  with a massive bombing of belgrade both nations were forced to surrender within the month the airborne invasion of the greek island of crete at the end of may completed the german conquest of the balkans partisan warfare subsequently broke out against the axis occupation of yugoslavia which continued until the end of the war in the middle east in may commonwealth forces quashed an uprising in iraq which had been supported by german aircraft from bases within vichycontrolled syria between june and july britishled forces invaded and occupied the french possessions of syria and lebanon assisted by the free french axis attack on the soviet union  with the situation in europe and asia relatively stable germany japan and the soviet union made preparations for war with the soviets wary of mounting tensions with germany and the japanese planning to take advantage of the european war by seizing resourcerich european possessions in southeast asia the two powers signed the sovietjapanese neutrality pact in april  by contrast the germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the soviet union massing forces on the soviet border hitler believed that the united kingdoms refusal to end the war was based on the hope that the united states and the soviet union would enter the war against germany on  july  hitler decided that the soviet union should be eliminated and aimed for the conquest of ukraine the baltic states and byelorussia however other senior german officials like ribbentrop saw an opportunity to create a euroasian bloc against the british empire by inviting the soviet union into the tripartite pact in november  negotiations took place to determine if the soviet union would join the pact the soviets showed some interest but asked for concessions from finland bulgaria turkey and japan that germany considered unacceptable on  december  hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the soviet union on  june  germany supported by italy and romania invaded the soviet union in operation barbarossa with germany accusing the soviets of plotting against them they were joined shortly by finland and hungary the primary targets of this surprise offensive were the baltic region moscow and ukraine with the ultimate goal of ending the  campaign near the arkhangelskastrakhan linefrom the caspian to the white seas hitlers objectives were to eliminate the soviet union as a military power exterminate communism generate lebensraum living space by dispossessing the native population and guarantee access to the strategic resources needed to defeat germanys remaining rivals although the red army was preparing for strategic counteroffensives before the war operation barbarossa forced the soviet supreme command to adopt strategic defence during the summer the axis made significant gains into soviet territory inflicting immense losses in both personnel and materiel mainly in massive encirclements around minsk smolensk and uman nazi policy entailed that wehrmacht subject soviet pows to murderous treatment executing all jewish and communist pows immediately per the commissar order and subjecting the remainder to forced marches to openair concentration camps where they were to be deliberately starved to death by the end of the winter of   million soviet pows had died in german captivity some  million soviet pows would die in german captivity by the wars end in total a nearly  mortality rate by midaugust however the german army high command decided to suspend the offensive of a considerably depleted army group centre and to divert the nd panzer group to reinforce troops advancing towards central ukraine and leningrad the kiev offensive was overwhelmingly successful resulting in encirclement and elimination of four soviet armies and made possible further advance into crimea and industriallydeveloped eastern ukraine the first battle of kharkov the diversion of threequarters of the axis troops and the majority of their air forces from france and the central mediterranean to the eastern front prompted the united kingdom to reconsider its grand strategy in july the uk and the soviet union formed a military alliance against germany and in august the united kingdom and the united states jointly issued the atlantic charter which outlined british and american goals for the postwar world in late august the british and soviets invaded neutral iran to secure the persian corridor irans oil fields and preempt any axis advances through iran toward the baku oil fields or india by october axis powers had achieved operational objectives in ukraine and the baltic region with only the sieges of leningrad and sevastopol continuing a major offensive against moscow was renewed after two months of fierce battles in increasingly harsh weather the german army almost reached the outer suburbs of moscow where the exhausted troops were forced to suspend the offensive large territorial gains were made by axis forces but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives two key cities remained in soviet hands the soviet capability to resist was not broken and the soviet union retained a considerable part of its military potential the blitzkrieg phase of the war in europe had ended by early december freshly mobilised reserves allowed the soviets to achieve numerical parity with axis troops this as well as intelligence data which established that a minimal number of soviet troops in the east would be sufficient to deter any attack by the japanese kwantung army allowed the soviets to begin a massive counteroffensive that started on  december all along the front and pushed german troops  kilometres  mi west war breaks out in the pacific  following the japanese false flag mukden incident in  the japanese shelling of the american gunboat uss panay in  and the  nanjing massacre japaneseamerican relations deteriorated in  the united states notified japan that it would not be extending its trade treaty and american public opinion opposing japanese expansionism led to a series of economic sanctionsthe export control actswhich banned us exports of chemicals minerals and military parts to japan and increased economic pressure on the japanese regime during  japan launched its first attack against changsha but was repulsed by late september despite several offensives by both sides by  the war between china and japan was at a stalemate to increase pressure on china by blocking supply routes and to better position japanese forces in the event of a war with the western powers japan invaded and occupied northern indochina in september  chinese nationalist forces launched a largescale counteroffensive in early  in august chinese communists launched an offensive in central china in retaliation japanese armies in north china implemented the three alls policy a massive scorched earth initiative to depopulate regions deemed hostile to japanese occupation continued antipathy between chinese communist and nationalist forces culminated in armed clashes in january  effectively ending their cooperation in march the japanese th army attacked the headquarters of the nationalist chinese th army but was repulsed during the battle of shanggao in september japan attempted to take the city of changsha again and clashed with chinese nationalist forces german successes in europe prompted japan to increase pressure on european governments in southeast asia the dutch government agreed to provide japan with oil supplies from the dutch east indies but negotiations for additional access to their resources ended in failure in june  in july  japan sent troops to southern indochina threatening british and dutch possessions in the far east the united states the united kingdom and other western governments reacted to this move with a freeze on japanese assets and a total oil embargo at the same time japan was planning an invasion of the soviet far east intending to take advantage of the german invasion in the west but abandoned the operation after the sanctions since early  the united states and japan had been engaged in negotiations in an attempt to improve their strained relations and end the war in china japan advanced a number of proposals which were dismissed by the americans as inadequate at the same time the united states the united kingdom and the netherlands engaged in secret discussions for the joint defence of their territories in the event of a japanese attack against any of them roosevelt reinforced the philippines an american protectorate scheduled for independence in  and warned japan that the united states would react to japanese attacks against any neighboring countries frustrated at the lack of progress and pressured by americanbritishdutch sanctions especially in oil japan prepared for war emperor hirohito after initial hesitation about japans chances of victory began to favour japans entry into the war as a result prime minister fumimaro konoe resigned hirohito refused the recommendation to appoint prince naruhiko higashikuni in his place choosing war minister hideki tojo instead on  november nagano explained in detail the plan of the attack on pearl harbor to the emperor on  november hirohito approved in imperial conference the operations plan for the war on  november the new government presented an interim proposal as its final offer it called for the end of american aid to china and for lifting the embargo on the supply of oil and other resources to japan in exchange japan promised not to launch any attacks in southeast asia and to withdraw its forces from southern indochina the american counterproposal of  november required that japan evacuate all of china without conditions and conclude nonaggression pacts with all pacific powers that meant japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in china or seizing the natural resources it needed in the dutch east indies by force the japanese military did not consider the former an option and many officers considered the oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war japan planned to seize european colonies in asia to create a large defensive perimeter stretching into the central pacific the japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of southeast asia while exhausting the overstretched allies by fighting a defensive war to prevent american intervention while securing the perimeter it was further planned to neutralise the united states pacific fleet and the american military presence in the philippines from the outset on  december   december in asian time zones japan attacked british and american holdings with nearsimultaneous offensives against southeast asia and the central pacific these included an attack on the american fleets at pearl harbor and the philippines as well as invasions of guam wake island malaya thailand and hong kong these attacks led the united states united kingdom china australia and several other states to formally declare war on japan whereas the soviet union being heavily involved in largescale hostilities with european axis countries maintained its neutrality agreement with japan germany followed by the other axis states declared war on the united states in solidarity with japan citing as justification the american attacks on german war vessels that had been ordered by roosevelt axis advance stalls  on  january  the allied big fourthe soviet union china the united kingdom and the united statesand  smaller or exiled governments issued the declaration by united nations thereby affirming the atlantic charter and agreeing not to sign a separate peace with the axis powers during  allied officials debated on the appropriate grand strategy to pursue all agreed that defeating germany was the primary objective the americans favoured a straightforward largescale attack on germany through france the soviets demanded a second front the british argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out german strength leading to increasing demoralisation and bolstering resistance forces germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing campaign an offensive against germany would then be launched primarily by allied armour without using largescale armies eventually the british persuaded the americans that a landing in france was infeasible in  and they should instead focus on driving the axis out of north africa at the casablanca conference in early  the allies reiterated the statements issued in the  declaration and demanded the unconditional surrender of their enemies the british and americans agreed to continue to press the initiative in the mediterranean by invading sicily to fully secure the mediterranean supply routes although the british argued for further operations in the balkans to bring turkey into the war in may  the americans extracted a british commitment to limit allied operations in the mediterranean to an invasion of the italian mainland and to invade france in  pacific  by the end of april  japan and its ally thailand had almost conquered burma malaya the dutch east indies singapore and rabaul inflicting severe losses on allied troops and taking a large number of prisoners japanese advances were accompanied by numerous atrocities including the sook ching massacre in singapore despite stubborn resistance by filipino and us forces the philippine commonwealth was eventually captured in may  forcing its government into exile following the capture of bataan japanese armies forced some  filipino and american prisoners on a km death march resulting in thousands of deaths on  april in burma  british soldiers were encircled by the japanese rd division during the battle of yenangyaung and rescued by the chinese th division japanese forces achieved naval victories in the south china sea java sea and indian ocean and bombed the allied naval base at darwin australia in january  the only allied success against japan was a chinese victory at changsha these easy victories over the unprepared us and european opponents left japan overconfident and overextended in early may  japan initiated operations to capture port moresby by amphibious assault and thus sever communications and supply lines between the united states and australia the planned invasion was thwarted when an allied task force centred on two american fleet carriers fought japanese naval forces to a draw in the battle of the coral sea japans next plan motivated by the earlier doolittle raid was to seize midway atoll and lure american carriers into battle to be eliminated as a diversion japan would also send forces to occupy the aleutian islands in alaska in midmay japan started the zhejiangjiangxi campaign in china with the goal of inflicting retribution on the chinese who aided the surviving american airmen in the doolittle raid by destroying chinese air bases and fighting against the chinese rd and nd army groups in early june japan put its operations into action but the americans had broken japanese naval codes in late may and were fully aware of the plans and order of battle and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive victory at midway over the imperial japanese navy with its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the midway battle japan attempted to capture port moresby by an overland campaign in the territory of papua the americans planned a counterattack against japanese positions in the southern solomon islands primarily guadalcanal as a first step towards capturing rabaul the main japanese base in southeast asia both plans started in july but by midseptember the battle for guadalcanal took priority for the japanese and troops in new guinea were ordered to withdraw from the port moresby area to the northern part of the island where they faced australian and united states troops in the battle of bunagona guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for guadalcanal with japanese forces suffering massive losses in the attrition especially amongst their elite pilots by the start of  the japanese were defeated on the island and withdrew their troops in burma commonwealth forces mounted two operations the first was a disastrous offensive into the arakan region in late  that forced a retreat back to india by may  the second was the insertion of irregular forces behind japanese frontlines in february which by the end of april had achieved mixed results eastern front  despite considerable losses in early  germany and its allies stopped a major soviet offensive in central and southern russia keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year in may the germans defeated soviet offensives in the kerch peninsula and at kharkov the fortress city of sevastopol which the red army had held out against axis siege for nearly  days was finally seized with the use of massive artillery bombardments and poison gas in june  launched their main summer offensive against southern russia to seize the oil fields of the caucasus and occupy the kuban steppe while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front the germans split army group south into two groups army group a advanced to the lower don river and struck southeast to the caucasus while army group b headed towards the volga river the soviets decided to make their stand at stalingrad on the volga by midnovember the germans had nearly taken stalingrad in bitter street fighting the soviets began their second winter counteroffensive starting with an encirclement of the german sixth army at stalingrad and an assault on the rzhev salient near moscow though the latter failed by early february  the german army had taken tremendous losses german troops at stalingrad had been defeated and the frontline had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive in midfebruary after the soviet push had tapered off the germans launched another attack on kharkov creating a salient in their front line around the soviet city of kursk western europeatlantic and mediterranean  exploiting poor american naval command decisions the german navy ravaged allied shipping off the american atlantic coast by november  commonwealth forces had launched a counteroffensive in north africa operation crusader and reclaimed all the gains the germans and italians had made the germans also launched a north african offensive in january pushing the british back to positions at the gazala line by early february followed by a temporary lull in combat which germany used to prepare for their upcoming offensives concerns that the japanese might use bases in vichyheld madagascar caused the british to invade the island in early may  an axis offensive in libya forced an allied retreat deep inside egypt until axis forces were stopped at el alamein on the continent raids of allied commandos on strategic targets culminating in the failed dieppe raid demonstrated the western allies inability to launch an invasion of continental europe without much better preparation equipment and operational security in august  the allies succeeded in repelling a second attack against el alamein and at a high cost managed to deliver desperately needed supplies to the besieged malta a few months later the allies commenced an attack of their own in egypt dislodging the axis forces and beginning a drive west across libya this attack was followed up shortly after by angloamerican landings in french north africa which resulted in the region joining the allies hitler responded to the french colonys defection by ordering the occupation of vichy france although vichy forces did not resist this violation of the armistice they managed to scuttle their fleet to prevent its capture by german forces axis forces in africa withdrew into tunisia which was conquered by the allies in may  in june  the british and americans began a strategic bombing campaign against germany with a goal to disrupt the war economy reduce morale and dehouse the civilian population the firebombing of hamburg was among the first attacks in this campaign inflicting significant casualties and considerable losses on infrastructure of this important industrial centre allies gain momentum  after the guadalcanal campaign the allies initiated several operations against japan in the pacific in may  canadian and us forces were sent to eliminate japanese forces from the aleutians soon after the united states with support from australia new zealand and pacific islander forces began major ground sea and air operations to isolate rabaul by capturing surrounding islands and breach the japanese central pacific perimeter at the gilbert and marshall islands by the end of march  the allies had completed both of these objectives and had also neutralised the major japanese base at truk in the caroline islands in april the allies launched an operation to retake western new guinea in the soviet union both the germans and the soviets spent the spring and early summer of  preparing for large offensives in central russia on  july  germany attacked soviet forces around the kursk bulge within a week german forces had exhausted themselves against the soviets wellconstructed defences and for the first time in the war hitler cancelled an operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success this decision was partially affected by the western allies invasion of sicily launched on  july which combined with previous italian failures resulted in the ousting and arrest of mussolini later that month on  july  the soviets launched their own counteroffensives thereby nearly completely dispelling any chance of german victory or even stalemate in the east the soviet victory at kursk marked the end of german superiority giving the soviet union the initiative on the eastern front the germans tried to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified pantherwotan line but the soviets broke through it at smolensk and the lower dnieper offensive on  september  the western allies invaded the italian mainland following italys armistice with the allies and the ensuing german occupation of italy germany with the help of the fascists responded to the armistice by disarming italian forces that were in many places without superior orders seizing military control of italian areas and creating a series of defensive lines german special forces then rescued mussolini who then soon established a new client state in germanoccupied italy named the italian social republic causing an italian civil war the western allies fought through several lines until reaching the main german defensive line in midnovember german operations in the atlantic also suffered by may  as allied countermeasures became increasingly effective the resulting sizeable german submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the german atlantic naval campaign in november  franklin d roosevelt and winston churchill met with chiang kaishek in cairo and then with joseph stalin in tehran the former conference determined the postwar return of japanese territory and the military planning for the burma campaign while the latter included agreement that the western allies would invade europe in  and that the soviet union would declare war on japan within three months of germanys defeat from november  during the sevenweek battle of changde the chinese awaited allied relief as they forced japan to fight a costly war of attrition in january  the allies launched a series of attacks in italy against the line at monte cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at anzio on  january  soviet troops launched a major offensive that expelled german forces from the leningrad region thereby ending the most lethal siege in history the following soviet offensive was halted on the prewar estonian border by the german army group north aided by estonians hoping to reestablish national independence this delay slowed subsequent soviet operations in the baltic sea region by late may  the soviets had liberated crimea largely expelled axis forces from ukraine and made incursions into romania which were repulsed by the axis troops the allied offensives in italy had succeeded and at the cost of allowing several german divisions to retreat rome was captured on  june the allies had mixed success in mainland asia in march  the japanese launched the first of two invasions an operation against allied positions in assam india and soon besieged commonwealth positions at imphal and kohima in may  british and indian forces mounted a counteroffensive that drove japanese troops back to burma by july and chinese forces that had invaded northern burma in late  besieged japanese troops in myitkyina the second japanese invasion of china aimed to destroy chinas main fighting forces secure railways between japaneseheld territory and capture allied airfields by june the japanese had conquered the province of henan and begun a new attack on changsha allies offensives  on  june  commonly known as dday after three years of soviet pressure the western allies invaded northern france after reassigning several allied divisions from italy they also attacked southern france these landings were successful and led to the defeat of the german army units in france paris was liberated on  august by the local resistance assisted by the free french forces both led by general charles de gaulle and the western allies continued to push back german forces in western europe during the latter part of the year an attempt to advance into northern germany spearheaded by a major airborne operation in the netherlands failed after that the western allies slowly pushed into germany but failed to cross the roer river in italy the allied advance slowed due to the last major german defensive line on  june the soviets launched a strategic offensive in belarus that nearly destroyed the german army group centre soon after that another soviet strategic offensive forced german troops from western ukraine and eastern poland the soviet red army however halted in the praga district on the other side of the vistula as the germans quelled the warsaw uprising initiated by the home army the main faction of the polish resistance loyal to the noncommunist governmentin exile killing over  poles the national uprising in slovakia was also quelled by the germans the soviet red armys strategic offensive in eastern romania cut off and destroyed the considerable german troops there and triggered a successful coup detat in romania and in bulgaria followed by those countries shift to the allied side in september  soviet troops advanced into yugoslavia and forced the rapid withdrawal of german army groups e and f in greece albania and yugoslavia to rescue them from being cut off by this point the communistled partisans under marshal josip broz tito who had led an increasingly successful guerrilla campaign against the occupation since  controlled much of the territory of yugoslavia and engaged in delaying efforts against german forces further south in northern serbia the soviet red army with limited support from bulgarian forces assisted the partisans in a joint liberation of the capital city of belgrade on  october a few days later the soviets launched a massive assault against germanoccupied hungary that lasted until the fall of budapest in february  unlike rapid soviet victories in the balkans bitter finnish resistance to the soviet offensive in the karelian isthmus denied the soviets occupation of finland and led to a sovietfinnish armistice on relatively mild conditions although finland was obligated to fight their german former allies by the start of july  commonwealth forces in southeast asia had repelled the japanese sieges in assam pushing the japanese back to the chindwin river while the chinese captured myitkyina in september  chinese forces captured mount song and reopened the burma road in china the japanese had more successes having finally captured changsha in midjune and the city of hengyang by early august soon after they invaded the province of guangxi winning major engagements against chinese forces at guilin and liuzhou by the end of november and successfully linking up their forces in china and indochina by middecember in the pacific us forces continued to push back the japanese perimeter in midjune  they began their offensive against the mariana and palau islands and decisively defeated japanese forces in the battle of the philippine sea these defeats led to the resignation of the japanese prime minister hideki tojo and provided the united states with air bases to launch intensive heavy bomber attacks on the japanese home islands in late october american forces invaded the filipino island of leyte soon after allied naval forces scored another large victory in the battle of leyte gulf one of the largest naval battles in history axis collapse and allied victory  on  december  germany made a last attempt to split the allies on the western front by using most of its remaining reserves to launch a massive counteroffensive in the ardennes and along the frenchgerman border hoping to encircle large portions of western allied troops and prompt a political settlement after capturing their primary supply port at antwerp by  january  this offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled in italy the western allies remained stalemated at the german defensive line in midjanuary  the red army attacked in poland pushing from the vistula to the oder river in germany and overran east prussia on  february soviet british and us leaders met for the yalta conference they agreed on the occupation of postwar germany and on when the soviet union would join the war against japan in february the soviets entered silesia and pomerania while the western allies entered western germany and closed to the rhine river by march the western allies crossed the rhine north and south of the ruhr encircling the german army group b in early march in an attempt to protect its last oil reserves in hungary and retake budapest germany launched its last major offensive against soviet troops near lake balaton within two weeks the offensive had been repulsed the soviets advanced to vienna and captured the city in early april soviet troops captured konigsberg while the western allies finally pushed forward in italy and swept across western germany capturing hamburg and nuremberg american and soviet forces met at the elbe river on  april leaving unoccupied pockets in southern germany and around berlin soviet troops stormed and captured berlin in late april in italy german forces surrendered on  april while the italian social republic capitulated two days later on  april the reichstag was captured signalling the military defeat of nazi germany major changes in leadership occurred on both sides during this period on  april president roosevelt died and was succeeded by his vice president harry s truman benito mussolini was killed by italian partisans on  april on  april hitler committed suicide in his headquarters and was succeeded by grand admiral karl donitz as president of the reich and joseph goebbels as chancellor of the reich goebbels also committed suicide on the following day and was replaced by lutz graf schwerin von krosigk in what would later be known as the flensburg government total and unconditional surrender in europe was signed on  and  may to be effective by the end of  may german army group centre resisted in prague until  may on  may all remaining members of the german government were arrested by allied forces in flensburg on  june all german political and military institutions were placed under allied control through the berlin declaration in the pacific theatre american forces accompanied by the forces of the philippine commonwealth advanced in the philippines clearing leyte by the end of april  they landed on luzon in january  and recaptured manila in march during which japanese forces killed  filipino civilians in the city fighting continued on luzon mindanao and other islands of the philippines until the end of the war meanwhile the united states army air forces launched a massive firebombing campaign of strategic cities in japan in an effort to destroy japanese war industry and civilian morale a devastating bombing raid on tokyo of  march was the deadliest conventional bombing raid in history in may  australian troops landed in borneo overrunning the oilfields there british american and chinese forces defeated the japanese in northern burma in march and the british pushed on to reach rangoon by  may chinese forces started a counterattack in the battle of west hunan that occurred between  april and  june  american naval and amphibious forces also moved towards japan taking iwo jima by march and okinawa by the end of june at the same time a naval blockade by submarines was strangling japans economy and drastically reducing its ability to supply overseas forces on  july allied leaders met in potsdam germany they confirmed earlier agreements about germany and the american british and chinese governments reiterated the demand for unconditional surrender of japan specifically stating that the alternative for japan is prompt and utter destruction during this conference the united kingdom held its general election and clement attlee replaced churchill as prime minister the call for unconditional surrender was rejected by the japanese government which believed it would be capable of negotiating for more favourable surrender terms in early august the united states dropped atomic bombs on the japanese cities of hiroshima and nagasaki between the two bombings the soviets pursuant to the yalta agreement declared war on japan invaded japaneseheld manchuria and quickly defeated the kwantung army which was the largest japanese fighting force these two events persuaded previously adamant imperial army leaders to accept surrender terms the red army also captured the southern part of sakhalin island and the kuril islands on the night of  august  emperor hirohito ordered the japanese cabinet to accept the terms demanded by the allies in the potsdam declaration on  august the emperor communicated this decision to the japanese people through a speech broadcast on the radio gyokuonhoso literally broadcast in the emperors voice on  august  japan surrendered with the surrender documents finally signed at tokyo bay on the deck of the american battleship uss missouri on  september  ending the war aftermath the allies established occupation administrations in austria and germany both initially divided between western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the western allies and the soviet union respectively however their paths soon diverged in germany the western and eastern occupation zones officially ended in  with the respective zones becoming separate countries west germany and east germany in austria however occupation continued until  when a joint settlement between the western allies and the soviet union permitted the reunification of austria as a democratic state officially nonaligned with any political bloc although in practice having better relations with the western allies a denazification program in germany led to the prosecution of nazi war criminals in the nuremberg trials and the removal of exnazis from power although this policy moved towards amnesty and reintegration of exnazis into west german society germany lost a quarter of its prewar  territory among the eastern territories silesia neumark and most of pomerania were taken over by poland and east prussia was divided between poland and the soviet union followed by the expulsion to germany of the nine million germans from these provinces as well as three million germans from the sudetenland in czechoslovakia by the s onefifth of west germans were refugees from the east the soviet union also took over the polish provinces east of the curzon line from which two million poles were expelled northeast romania parts of eastern finland and the baltic states were annexed into the soviet union italy lost its monarchy colonial empire and some european territories in an effort to maintain world peace the allies formed the united nations which officially came into existence on  october  and adopted the universal declaration of human rights in  as a common standard for all member nations the great powers that were the victors of the warfrance china the united kingdom the soviet union and the united statesbecame the permanent members of the uns security council the five permanent members remain so to the present although there have been two seat changes between the republic of china and the peoples republic of china in  and between the soviet union and its successor state the russian federation following the dissolution of the soviet union in  the alliance between the western allies and the soviet union had begun to deteriorate even before the war was over besides germany the rest of europe was also divided into western and soviet spheres of influence most eastern and central european countries fell into the soviet sphere which led to the establishment of communistled regimes with full or partial support of the soviet occupation authorities as a result east germany poland hungary romania bulgaria czechoslovakia and albania became soviet satellite states communist yugoslavia conducted a fully independent policy causing tension with the soviet union a communist uprising in greece was put down with angloamerican support and the country remained aligned with the west postwar division of the world was formalised by two international military alliances the united statesled nato and the sovietled warsaw pact the long period of political tensions and military competition between themthe cold warwould be accompanied by an unprecedented arms race and number of proxy wars throughout the world in asia the united states led the occupation of japan and administered japans former islands in the western pacific while the soviets annexed south sakhalin and the kuril islands korea formerly under japanese colonial rule was divided and occupied by the soviet union in the north and the united states in the south between  and  separate republics emerged on both sides of the th parallel in  each claiming to be the legitimate government for all of korea which led ultimately to the korean war in china nationalist and communist forces resumed the civil war in june  communist forces prevailed and established the peoples republic of china on the mainland while nationalist forces retreated to taiwan in  in the middle east the arab rejection of the united nations partition plan for palestine and the creation of israel marked the escalation of the arabisraeli conflict while european powers attempted to retain some or all of their colonial empires their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful leading to decolonisation the global economy suffered heavily from the war although participating nations were affected differently the united states emerged much richer than any other nation leading to a baby boom and by  its gross domestic product per person was much greater than that of any of the other powers and it dominated the world economy the allied occupational authorities pursued a policy of industrial disarmament in western germany from  to  due to international trade interdependencies this policy led to an economic stagnation in europe and delayed european recovery from the war for several years at the bretton woods conference in july  the allied nations drew up an economic framework for the postwar world the agreement created the international monetary fund imf and the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd which later became part of the world bank group the bretton woods system lasted until  recovery began with the mid currency reform in west germany and was sped up by the liberalisation of european economic policy that the us marshall plan economic aid  both directly and indirectly caused the post west german recovery has been called the german economic miracle italy also experienced an economic boom and the french economy rebounded by contrast the united kingdom was in a state of economic ruin and although receiving a quarter of the total marshall plan assistance more than any other european country it continued in relative economic decline for decades the soviet union despite enormous human and material losses also experienced rapid increases in production in the immediate postwar era having seized and transferred most of germanys industrial plants and exacted war reparations from its satellite states japan recovered much later china returned to its prewar industrial production by  impact casualties and war crimes an estimated  million to more than  million people died in the war including at least  million who died from deprivation famine and disease the majority of these deaths were on the eastern front and the chinese theatre the soviet union lost around  million people including  million military and  million civilian deaths a quarter of the soviet population were wounded or killed germany sustained  million military losses mostly on the eastern front and during the final battles in germany an estimated  to  million civilians died as a direct or as an indirect result of hitlers racist policies including mass killing of around  million jews along with roma homosexuals at least  million ethnic poles and millions of other slavs including russians ukrainians and belarusians and other ethnic and minority groups between  and  more than  yugoslavians died  were ethnic serbs along with roma and jews were persecuted and killed by the axisaligned croatian ustase in yugoslavia concurrently muslims and croats were persecuted and killed by serb nationalist chetniks with an estimated  victims of which  were civilians also more than  poles were massacred by the ukrainian insurgent army in the volhynia massacres between  and  at the same time about  ukrainians were killed by the polish home army and other units in reprisal attacks the number of deaths resulting from the war in asia and the pacific is contested estimates of chinese deaths range from  million to over  million arne westad estimates  million chinese died directly from war of which two million were soldiers and the rest civilians rana mitter considers westads figures conservative an estimated  died as a result of nationalist forces flooding the yellow river in the nanking massacre between  and  chinese civilians and pows were killed by japanese forces while another  were raped another  million chinese civilians were killed by japanese forces during the three alls policy japanese forces killed between  million and  million civilians in southeast asia at least a million civilians died in indochina while as many as  million died in the dutch east indies  million of which died on java from famine between  and  filipino civilians died during the japanese occupation and american liberation estimates of the number of people killed by japanese forces in all theatres are as high as  million axis forces employed biological and chemical weapons the imperial japanese army used a variety of such weapons during its invasion and occupation of china see unit  and in early conflicts against the soviets both the germans and the japanese tested such weapons against civilians and sometimes on prisoners of war the soviet union was responsible for the katyn massacre of  polish officers and the imprisonment or execution of hundreds of thousands of political prisoners by the nkvd secret police along with mass civilian deportations to siberia in the baltic states and eastern poland annexed by the red army soviet soldiers committed mass rapes in occupied territories especially in germany the exact number of german women and girls raped by soviet troops during the war and occupation is uncertain but historians estimate their numbers are likely in the hundreds of thousands and possibly as many as two million while figures for women raped by german soldiers in the soviet union go as far as ten million the mass bombing of cities in europe and asia has often been called a war crime although no positive or specific customary international humanitarian law with respect to aerial warfare existed before or during world war ii the usaaf bombed a total of  japanese cities killing  civilians including the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki and destroying  of builtup areas genocide concentration camps and slave labour nazi germany under the dictatorship of adolf hitler was responsible for killing about  million jews in what is now known as the holocaust they also killed an additional  million others who were deemed unworthy of life including the disabled and mentally ill soviet prisoners of war romani homosexuals freemasons and jehovahs witnesses as part of a program of deliberate extermination in effect becoming a genocidal state soviet pows were kept in especially unbearable conditions and  million soviet pows out of  million died in nazi camps during the war in addition to concentration camps death camps were created in nazi germany to exterminate people on an industrial scale nazi germany extensively used forced labourers about  million europeans from germanoccupied countries were abducted and used as a slave work force in german industry agriculture and war economy the soviet gulag became a de facto system of deadly camps during  when wartime privation and hunger caused numerous deaths of inmates including foreign citizens of poland and other countries occupied in  by the soviet union as well as axis pows by the end of the war most soviet pows liberated from nazi camps and many repatriated civilians were detained in special filtration camps where they were subjected to nkvd evaluation and  were sent to the gulag as real or perceived nazi collaborators japanese prisonerofwar camps many of which were used as labour camps also had high death rates the international military tribunal for the far east found the death rate of western prisoners was  percent for american pows  percent seven times that of pows under the germans and italians while  prisoners from the uk  from the netherlands and  from the united states were released after the surrender of japan the number of chinese released was only  at least five million chinese civilians from northern china and manchukuo were enslaved between  and  by the east asia development board or koain for work in mines and war industries after  the number reached  million in java between  and  million romusha japanese manual labourers were forced to work by the japanese military about  of these javanese labourers were sent to other japaneseheld areas in southeast asia and only  were repatriated to java occupation in europe occupation came under two forms in western northern and central europe france norway denmark the low countries and the annexed portions of czechoslovakia germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly  billion reichsmarks  billion us dollars by the end of the war this figure does not include the plunder of industrial products military equipment raw materials and other goods thus the income from occupied nations was over  percent of the income germany collected from taxation a figure which increased to nearly  percent of total german income as the war went on in the east the intended gains of lebensraum were never attained as fluctuating frontlines and soviet scorched earth policies denied resources to the german invaders unlike in the west the nazi racial policy encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered to be the inferior people of slavic descent most german advances were thus followed by mass atrocities and war crimes the nazis killed an estimated  million ethnic poles in addition to polishjewish victims of the holocaust although by  resistance groups formed in most occupied territories the assessments of the effectiveness of soviet partisans and french resistance suggests that they did not significantly hamper german operations until late  in asia japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the greater east asia coprosperity sphere essentially a japanese hegemony which it claimed was for purposes of liberating colonised peoples although japanese forces were sometimes welcomed as liberators from european domination japanese war crimes frequently turned local public opinion against them during japans initial conquest it captured  barrels  m of oil  tonnes left behind by retreating allied forces and by  was able to get production in the dutch east indies up to  million barrels  m of oil  million tonnes  percent of its  output rate home fronts and production in the s britain and the united states together controlled almost  of world mineral outputessential for projecting military power in europe before the outbreak of the war the allies had significant advantages in both population and economics in  the western allies united kingdom france poland and the british dominions had a  percent larger population and a  percent higher gross domestic product than the european axis powers germany and italy including colonies the allies had more than a  advantage in population and a nearly  advantage in gdp in asia at the same time china had roughly six times the population of japan but only an  percent higher gdp this reduces to three times the population and only a  percent higher gdp if japanese colonies are included the united states produced about twothirds of all munitions used by the allies in world war ii including warships transports warplanes artillery tanks trucks and ammunition although the allies economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of germany and japan they became the decisive factor by  after the united states and soviet union joined the allies and the war evolved into one of attrition while the allies ability to outproduce the axis was partly due to more access to natural resources other factors such as germany and japans reluctance to employ women in the labour force allied strategic bombing and germanys late shift to a war economy contributed significantly additionally neither germany nor japan planned to fight a protracted war and had not equipped themselves to do so to improve their production germany and japan used millions of slave labourers germany enslaved about  million people mostly from eastern europe while japan used more than  million people in far east asia advances in technology and its application aircraft were used for reconnaissance as fighters bombers and groundsupport and each role developed considerably innovations included airlift the capability to quickly move limited highpriority supplies equipment and personnel and strategic bombing the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemys ability to wage war antiaircraft weaponry also advanced including defences such as radar and surfacetoair artillery in particular the introduction of the proximity fuze the use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide advances were made in nearly every aspect of naval warfare most notably with aircraft carriers and submarines although aeronautical warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war actions at taranto pearl harbor and the coral sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of the battleship in the atlantic escort carriers became a vital part of allied convoys increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the midatlantic gap carriers were also more economical than battleships due to the relatively low cost of aircraft and because they are not required to be as heavily armoured submarines which had proved to be an effective weapon during the first world war were expected by all combatants to be important in the second the british focused development on antisubmarine weaponry and tactics such as sonar and convoys while germany focused on improving its offensive capability with designs such as the type vii submarine and wolfpack tactics gradually improving allied technologies such as the leigh light hedgehog squid and homing torpedoes proved effective against german submarines land warfare changed from the static frontlines of trench warfare of world war i which had relied on improved artillery that outmatched the speed of both infantry and cavalry to increased mobility and combined arms the tank which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the first world war had evolved into the primary weapon in the late s tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during world war i and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed armour and firepower at the start of the war most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications this idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour and german doctrine of avoiding tankversustank combat this along with germanys use of combined arms were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across poland and france many means of destroying tanks including indirect artillery antitank guns both towed and selfpropelled mines shortranged infantry antitank weapons and other tanks were used even with largescale mechanisation infantry remained the backbone of all forces and throughout the war most infantry were equipped similarly to world war i the portable machine gun spread a notable example being the german mg  and various submachine guns which were suited to close combat in urban and jungle settings the assault rifle a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and submachine gun became the standard postwar infantry weapon for most armed forces most major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security involved in using large codebooks for cryptography by designing ciphering machines the most wellknown being the german enigma machine development of sigint signals intelligence and cryptanalysis enabled the countering process of decryption notable examples were the allied decryption of japanese naval codes and british ultra a pioneering method for decoding enigma that benefited from information given to the united kingdom by the polish cipher bureau which had been decoding early versions of enigma before the war another component of military intelligence was deception which the allies used to great effect in operations such as mincemeat and bodyguard other technological and engineering feats achieved during or as a result of the war include the worlds first programmable computers z colossus and eniac guided missiles and modern rockets the manhattan projects development of nuclear weapons operations research the development of artificial harbours and oil pipelines under the english channel although penicillin was discovered before the war the development of industrial production technology as well as the mass production and
