due to his yearslong correspondence with william boyd a former associate professor of biochemistry at boston university who initially contacted asimov to compliment him on his story nightfall upon receiving a promotion to professor of immunochemistry boyd reached out to asimov requesting him to be his replacement the initial offer of professorship was withdrawn and asimov was offered the position of instructor of biochemistry instead which he accepted he began work in  with a  salary equivalent to  in  maintaining this position for several years by  however he was making more money as

childhood desire to own a magazine stand in a new york city subway station within which he could enclose himself and listen to the rumble of passing trains while reading asimov was afraid of flying doing so only twice once in the course of his work at the naval air experimental station and once returning home from oahu in  consequently he seldom traveled great distances this phobia influenced several of his fiction works such as the wendell urth mystery stories and the robot novels featuring elijah baley in his later years asimov found enjoyment traveling on cruise ships beginning in  when he viewed the apollo  launch from a cruise ship on several cruises he was part of the entertainment program giving sciencethemed talks aboard ships such as the queen elizabeth  he sailed to england in

the comic operas of gilbert and sullivan many of his short stories mention or quote gilbert and sullivan he was a prominent member of the baker street irregulars the leading sherlock holmes society for whom he wrote an essay arguing that professor moriartys work the dynamics of an asteroid involved the willful destruction of an ancient civilized planet he was also a member of the maleonly literary banqueting club the trap door spiders which served as the basis of his fictional group of mystery solvers the black widowers he later used his essay on moriartys work as the basis for a black

scientific investigation of claims of the paranormal csicop now the committee for skeptical inquiry and is listed in its pantheon of skeptics in a discussion with james randi at csicon  regarding the founding of csicop kendrick frazier said that asimov was a key figure in the skeptical movement who is less well known and appreciated today but was very much in the public eye back then he said that asimovs being associated with csicop gave it immense status and authority in his eyes asimov described carl sagan as one of only two people he ever met whose intellect surpassed his own the other he claimed was the computer scientist and artificial intelligence expert marvin minsky asimov was an onandoff member and honorary vice president of mensa international albeit reluctantly he described some members of that organization as brainproud and aggressive about their iqs after his father died in  asimov annually contributed to a judah asimov scholarship fund at brandeis university in  he

manhattan on april   and was cremated the cause of death was reported as heart and kidney failure ten years following asimovs death janet and robyn asimov agreed that the hiv story should be made public janet revealed it in her edition of his autobiography its been a good life writings the only thing about myself that i consider to be severe enough to warrant psychoanalytic treatment is my compulsion to write  that means that my idea of a pleasant time is to go up to my attic sit at my electric typewriter as i am doing right now and bang away watching the words take shape like magic before my eyes overview asimovs career can be divided into several periods his early career dominated by science fiction began with short stories in  and novels in  this lasted until about  all but ending after publication of the naked sun  he began publishing nonfiction as coauthor of a collegelevel textbook called biochemistry and human metabolism following the brief orbit of the first humanmade satellite sputnik i by the ussr in  he wrote more nonfiction particularly popular science books and less science fiction over the next quartercentury he wrote only four science fiction novels and  nonfiction books starting in  the second half of his science fiction career began with the publication of foundations edge from then until his death asimov published several more sequels and prequels to his existing novels tying them together in a way he had not originally anticipated making a unified series there are many inconsistencies in this unification especially in his earlier stories doubleday and houghton mifflin published about  of his work up to  asimov stating that both represent a father image asimov believed his most enduring contributions would be his three laws of robotics and the foundation series the oxford english dictionary credits his science fiction for introducing into the english language the words robotics positronic an entirely fictional technology and psychohistory which is also used for a different study on historical motivations asimov coined the term robotics without suspecting that it might be an original word at the time he believed it was simply the natural analogue of words such as mechanics and hydraulics but for robots unlike his word psychohistory the word robotics continues in mainstream technical use with asimovs original definition star trek the next generation featured androids with positronic brains and the firstseason episode datalore called the positronic brain asimovs dream asimov was so prolific and diverse in his writing that his books span all major categories of the dewey decimal classification except for category  philosophy and psychology however he wrote several essays about psychology and forewords for the books the humanist way  and in pursuit of truth  which were classified in the s category but none of his own books were classified in that category according to unescos index translationum database asimov is the worlds thmosttranslated author science fiction no matter how various the subject matter i write on i was a sciencefiction writer first and it is as a sciencefiction writer that i want to be identified asimov became a science fiction fan in  when he began reading the pulp magazines sold in his familys candy store at first his father forbade reading pulps until asimov persuaded him that because the science fiction magazines had science in the title they must be educational at age  he joined the futurians science fiction fan club where he made friends who went on to become science fiction writers or editors asimov began writing at the age of  imitating the rover boys with eight chapters of the greenville chums at college his father bought him a used typewriter at age  his first published work was a humorous item on the birth of his brother for boys high schools literary journal in  in may  he first thought of writing professionally and began writing his first science fiction story cosmic corkscrew now lost that year on may   puzzled by a change in the schedule of astounding science fiction asimov visited its publisher street  smith publications inspired by the visit he finished the story on june   and personally submitted it to astounding editor john w campbell two days later campbell met with asimov for more than an hour and promised to read the story himself two days later he received a detailed rejection letter this was the first of what became almost weekly meetings with the editor while asimov lived in new york until moving to boston in  campbell had a strong formative influence on asimov and became a personal friend by the end of the month asimov completed a second story stowaway campbell rejected it on july  butin the nicest possible letter you could imagineencouraged him to continue writing promising that asimov might sell his work after another year and a dozen stories of practice on october   he sold the third story he finished marooned off vesta to amazing stories edited by raymond a palmer and it appeared in the march  issue asimov was paid  equivalent to  in  or one cent a word two more stories appeared that year the weapon too dreadful to use in the may amazing and trends in the july astounding the issue fans later selected as the start of the golden age of science fiction for  isfdb catalogs seven stories in four different pulp magazines including one in astounding his earnings became enough to pay for his education but not yet enough for him to become a fulltime writer he later said that unlike other golden age writers heinlein and a e van vogtalso first published in  and whose talent and stardom were immediately obviousasimov this is not false modesty came up only gradually through july   asimov wrote  stories in  months of which  were published he wrote in  that from that date he never wrote a science fiction story that was not published except for two special cases by  asimov was famous enough that donald wollheim told him that he purchased the secret sense for a new magazine only because of his name and the december  issue of astonishingfeaturing asimovs name in boldwas the first magazine to base cover art on his work but asimov later said that neither he nor anyone elseexcept perhaps campbellconsidered him better than an often published third rater based on a conversation with campbell asimov wrote nightfall his nd story in march and april  and astounding published it in september  in  the science fiction writers of america voted nightfall the best science fiction short story ever written in nightfall and other stories asimov wrote the writing of nightfall was a watershed in my professional career  i was suddenly taken seriously and the world of science fiction became aware that i existed as the years passed in fact it became evident that i had written a classic nightfall is an archetypal example of social science fiction a term he created to describe a new trend in the s led by authors including him and heinlein away from gadgets and space opera and toward speculation about the human condition after writing victory unintentional in january and february  asimov did not write another story for a year he expected to make chemistry his career and was paid  annually at the philadelphia navy yard enough to marry his girlfriend he did not expect to make much more from writing than the  he had earned from the  stories he had already sold over four years asimov left science fiction fandom and no longer read new magazines and might have left the writing profession had not heinlein and de camp been his coworkers at the navy yard and previously sold stories continued to appear in  asimov published the first of his foundation storieslater collected in the foundation trilogy foundation  foundation and empire  and second foundation  the books describe the fall of a vast interstellar empire and the establishment of its eventual successor they feature his fictional science of psychohistory whose theories could predict the future course of history according to dynamical laws regarding the statistical analysis of mass human actions campbell raised his rate per word orson welles purchased rights to evidence and anthologies reprinted his stories by the end of the war asimov was earning as a writer an amount equal to half of his navy yard salary even after a raise but asimov still did not believe that writing could support him his wife and future children his positronic robot storiesmany of which were collected in i robot were begun at about the same time they promulgated a set of rules of ethics for robots see three laws of robotics and intelligent machines that greatly influenced other writers and thinkers in their treatment of the subject asimov notes in his introduction to the short story collection the complete robot  that he was largely inspired by the tendency of robots up to that time to fall consistently into a frankenstein plot in which they destroyed their creators the robot series has led to film adaptations with asimovs collaboration in about  harlan ellison wrote a screenplay of i robot that asimov hoped would lead to the first really adult complex worthwhile science fiction film ever made the screenplay has never been filmed and was eventually published in book form in  the  movie i robot starring will smith was based on an unrelated script by jeff vintar titled hardwired with asimovs ideas incorporated later after the rights to asimovs title were acquired the title was not original to asimov but had previously been used for a story by eando binder also one of asimovs robot short stories the bicentennial man was expanded into a novel the positronic man by asimov and robert silverberg and this was adapted into the  movie bicentennial man starring robin williams in  the foundation trilogy won the hugo award for the alltime best series of science fiction and fantasy novels and they along with the robot series are his most famous science fiction besides movies his foundation and robot stories have inspired other derivative works of science fiction literature many by wellknown and established authors such as roger macbride allen greg bear gregory benford david brin and donald kingsbury at least some of these appear to have been done with the blessing of or at the request of asimovs widow janet asimov in  he also wrote a spoof chemistry article the endochronic properties of resublimated thiotimoline at the time asimov was preparing his own doctoral dissertation which would include an oral examination fearing a prejudicial reaction from his graduate school evaluation board at columbia university asimov asked his editor that it be released under a pseudonym when it nevertheless appeared under his own name asimov grew concerned that his doctoral examiners might think he wasnt taking science seriously at the end of the examination one evaluator turned to him smiling and said what can you tell us mr asimov about the thermodynamic properties of the compound known as thiotimoline laughing hysterically with relief asimov had to be led out of the room after a fiveminute wait he was summoned back into the room and congratulated as dr asimov demand for science fiction greatly increased during the s making it possible for a genre author to write fulltime in  book publisher doubledays science fiction editor walter i bradbury accepted asimovs unpublished grow old with me  words but requested that it be extended to a full novel of  words the book appeared under the doubleday imprint in january  with the title of pebble in the sky doubleday published five more original science fiction novels by asimov in the s along with the six juvenile lucky starr novels the latter under the pseudonym paul french doubleday also published collections of asimovs short stories beginning with the martian way and other stories in  the early s also saw gnome press publish one collection of asimovs positronic robot stories as i robot and his foundation stories and novelettes as the three books of the foundation trilogy more positronic robot stories were republished in book form as the rest of the robots book publishers and the magazines galaxy and fantasy  science fiction ended asimovs dependence on astounding he later described the era as his mature period asimovs the last question  on the ability of humankind to cope with and potentially reverse the process of entropy was his personal favorite story in  his standalone novel the gods themselves was published to general acclaim winning best novel in the hugo nebula and locus awards in december  former beatle paul mccartney approached asimov and asked him to write the screenplay for a sciencefiction movie musical mccartney had a vague idea for the plot and a small scrap of dialogue about a rock band whose members discover they are being impersonated by extraterrestrials the band and their impostors would likely be played by mccartneys group wings then at the height of their career though not generally a fan of rock music asimov was intrigued by the idea and quickly produced a treatment outline of the story adhering to mccartneys overall idea but omitting mccartneys scrap of dialogue mccartney rejected it and the treatment now exists only in the boston university archives asimov said in  that he had the happiest of all my associations with science fiction magazines with fantasy  science fiction i have no complaints about astounding galaxy or any of the rest heaven knows but fsf has become something special to me beginning in  asimov lent his name to isaac asimovs science fiction magazine now asimovs science fiction and wrote an editorial for each issue there was also a shortlived asimovs sf adventure magazine and a companion asimovs science fiction anthology reprint series published as magazines in the same manner as the stablemates ellery queens mystery magazines and alfred hitchcocks mystery magazines anthologies due to pressure by fans on asimov to write another book in his foundation series he did so with foundations edge  and foundation and earth  and then went back to before the original trilogy with prelude to foundation  and forward the foundation  his last novel in  he collaborated with screen writer michael wagner as the creative consultant on the short lived sfdetective tv series probe starring parker stevenson he also helped leonard nimoy fleshing out the premise of the science fiction comic primortals  popular science just say i am one of the most versatile writers in the world and the greatest popularizer of many subjects asimov and two colleagues published a textbook in  with two more editions by  during the late s and s asimov substantially decreased his fiction output he published only four adult novels between s the naked sun and s foundations edge two of which were mysteries he greatly increased his nonfiction production writing mostly on science topics the launch of sputnik in  engendered public concern over a science gap asimov explained in the rest of the robots that he had been unable to write substantial fiction since the summer of  and observers understood him as saying that his fiction career had ended or was permanently interrupted asimov recalled in  that the united states went into a kind of tizzy and so did i i was overcome by the ardent desire to write popular science for an america that might be in great danger through its neglect of science and a number of publishers got an equally ardent desire to publish popular science for the same reason fantasy and science fiction invited asimov to continue his regular nonfiction column begun in the nowfolded bimonthly companion magazine venture science fiction magazine the first of  monthly fsf columns appeared in november  and they continued until his terminal illness these columns periodically collected into books by doubleday gave asimov a reputation as a great explainer of science he described them as his only popular science writing in which he never had to assume complete ignorance of the subjects on the part of his readers the column was ostensibly dedicated to popular science but asimov had complete editorial freedom and wrote about contemporary social issues in essays such as thinking about thinking and knock plastic in  he wrote of these essays i get more pleasure out of them than out of any other writing assignment asimovs first wideranging reference work the intelligent mans guide to science  was nominated for a national book award and in  he won a hugo awardhis firstfor his essays for fsf the popularity of his science books and the income he derived from them allowed him to give up most academic responsibilities and become a fulltime freelance writer he encouraged other science fiction writers to write popular science stating in  that the knowledgeable skillful science writer is worth his weight in contracts with twice as much work as he can possibly handle the great variety of information covered in asimovs writings prompted kurt vonnegut to ask how does it feel to know everything asimov replied that he only knew how it felt to have the reputation of omniscience uneasy floyd c gale said that asimov has a rare talent he can make your mental mouth water over dry facts and science fictions loss has been science popularizations gain asimov said that of all the writing i do fiction nonfiction adult or juvenile these f  sf articles are by far the most fun he regretted however that he had less time for fictioncausing dissatisfied readers to send him letters of complaintstating in  that in the last ten years ive done a couple of novels some collections a dozen or so stories but thats nothing in his essay to tell a chemist  asimov proposed a simple shibboleth for distinguishing chemists from nonchemists ask the person to read the word unionized chemists he noted will read unionized electrically neutral while nonchemists will read unionized belonging to a trade union coined terms asimov coined the term robotics in his may  story liar though he later remarked that he believed then that he was merely using an existing word as he stated in gold the robot chronicles while acknowledging the oxford dictionary reference he incorrectly states that the word was first printed about one third of the way down the first column of page  in the march  issue of astounding science fiction  the printing of his short story runaround in the same story asimov also coined the term positronic the counterpart to electronic for positrons asimov coined the term psychohistory in his foundation stories to name a fictional branch of science which combines history sociology and mathematical statistics to make general predictions about the future behavior of very large groups of people such as the galactic empire asimov said later that he should have called it psychosociology it was first introduced in the five short stories  which would later be collected as the  fixup novel foundation somewhat later the term psychohistory was applied by others to research of the effects of psychology on history other writings in addition to his interest in science asimov was interested in history starting in the s he wrote  popular history books including the greeks a great adventure  the roman republic  the roman empire  the egyptians  the near east  years of history  and asimovs chronology of the world  he published asimovs guide to the bible in two volumescovering the old testament in  and the new testament in and then combined them into one page volume in  complete with maps and tables the guide goes through the books of the bible in order explaining the history of each one and the political influences that affected it as well as biographical information about the important characters his interest in literature manifested itself in several annotations of literary works including asimovs guide to shakespeare  asimovs annotated don juan  asimovs annotated paradise lost  and the annotated gullivers travels  asimov was also a noted mystery author and a frequent contributor to ellery queens mystery magazine he began by writing science fiction mysteries such as his wendell urth stories but soon moved on to writing pure mysteries he published two fulllength mystery novels and wrote  stories about the black widowers a group of men who met monthly for dinner conversation and a puzzle he got the idea for the widowers from his own association in a stag group called the trap door spiders and all of the main characters with the exception of the waiter henry who he admitted resembled wodehouses jeeves were modeled after his closest friends a parody of the black widowers an evening with the white divorces was written by author critic and librarian jon l breen asimov joked all i can do  is to wait until i catch him in a dark alley someday toward the end of his life asimov published a series of collections of limericks mostly written by himself starting with lecherous limericks which appeared in  limericks too gross whose title displays asimovs love of puns contains  limericks by asimov and an equal number by john ciardi he even created a slim volume of sherlockian limericks asimov featured yiddish humor in azazel the two centimeter demon the two main characters both jewish talk over dinner or lunch or breakfast about anecdotes of george and his friend azazel asimovs treasury of humor is both a working joke book and a treatise propounding his views on humor theory according to asimov the most essential element of humor is an abrupt change in point of view one that suddenly shifts focus from the important to the trivial or from the sublime to the ridiculous particularly in his later years asimov to some extent cultivated an image of himself as an amiable lecher in  as a response to the popularity of sexual guidebooks such as the sensuous woman by j and the sensuous man by m asimov published the sensuous dirty old man under the byline dr a although his full name was printed on the paperback edition first published  however by  asimovs habit of groping women was seen as sexual harassment and came under criticism and was cited as an early example of inappropriate behavior that can occur at science fiction conventions asimov published three volumes of autobiography in memory yet green  and in joy still felt  cover his life up to  the third volume i asimov a memoir  covered his whole life rather than following on from where the second volume left off the epilogue was written by his widow janet asimov after his death the book won a hugo award in  janet asimov edited its been a good life  a condensed version of his three autobiographies he also published three volumes of retrospectives of his writing opus   opus   and opus   in  the asimovs cowrote how to enjoy

book includes many quotations essays anecdotes and husbandwife dialogues about the ups and downs of being an author asimov and star trek creator gene roddenberry developed a unique relationship during star treks initial launch in the late s asimov wrote a critical essay on star treks scientific accuracy for tv guide magazine roddenberry retorted respectfully with a personal letter explaining the limitations of accuracy when writing a weekly series asimov corrected himself with a followup essay to tv guide claiming that despite its inaccuracies star trek was a fresh and intellectually challenging science fiction television show the two remained friends to the point where asimov even served as an advisor on a number of star trek projects in  asimov published a proposal for calendar reform called the world season calendar it divides the year into four seasons named ad of  weeks  days each this allows days to be named eg d instead of december  due to december  being the rd day of the th quarter an extra year day is added for a total of  days awards and recognition asimov won more than a dozen annual awards for particular works of science fiction and a halfdozen lifetime awards

nothing of occasional colloquialisms this grates on people who like things that are poetic weighty complex and above all obscure on the other hand the informal style pleases people who enjoy the sensation of reading an essay without being aware that they are reading and of feeling that ideas are flowing from the writers brain into their own without mental friction asimov was his own secretary typist indexer proofreader and literary agent he wrote a typed first draft composed at the keyboard at  words per minute he imagined an ending first then a beginning then let everything inbetween work itself out as i come to it asimov used an outline only once later describing it as like trying to play the piano from inside a straitjacket after correcting a draft by hand he retyped the document as the final copy and only made one revision with minor editorrequested changes a word processor did not save him much time asimov said because  of the first draft was unchanged after disliking making multiple revisions of black friar of the flame asimov refused to make major second or noneditorial revisions like chewing used gum stating that too large a revision or too many revisions indicate that the piece of writing is a failure in the time it would take to salvage such a failure i could write a new piece altogether and have infinitely more fun in the process he submitted failures to another editor asimovs fiction style is extremely unornamented in  science fiction scholar james gunn wrote of i robot except for two storiesliar and evidencethey are not stories in which character plays a significant part virtually all plot develops in conversation with little if any action nor is there a great deal of local color or description of any kind the dialogue is at best functional and the style is at best transparent   the robot stories and as a matter of fact almost all asimov fictionplay themselves on a relatively bare stage asimov addressed such criticism in  at the beginning of nemesis i made up my mind long ago to follow one cardinal rule in all my writingto be clear i have given up all thought of writing poetically or symbolically or experimentally or in any of the other modes that might if i were good enough get me a pulitzer prize i would write merely clearly and in this way establish a warm relationship between myself and my readers and the professional criticswell they can do whatever they wish gunn cited examples of a more complex style such as the climax of liar sharply drawn characters occur at key junctures of his storylines susan calvin in liar and evidence arkady darell in second foundation elijah baley in the caves of steel and hari seldon in the foundation prequels other than books by gunn and joseph patrouch there is relatively little literary criticism on asimov particularly when compared to the sheer volume of his output cowart and wymers dictionary of literary biography  gives a possible reason his words do not easily lend themselves to traditional literary criticism because he has the habit of centering his fiction on plot and clearly stating to his reader in rather direct terms what is happening in his stories and why it is happening in fact most of the dialogue in an asimov story and particularly in the foundation trilogy is devoted to such exposition stories that clearly state what they mean in unambiguous language are the most difficult for a scholar to deal with because there is little to be interpreted gunns and patrouchs studies of asimov both state that a clear direct prose style is still a style gunns  book comments in detail on each of asimovs novels he does not praise all of asimovs fiction nor does patrouch but calls some passages in the caves of steel reminiscent of proust when discussing how that novel depicts night falling over futuristic new york city gunn says that asimovs prose need not be ashamed anywhere in literary society although he prided himself on his unornamented prose style for which he credited clifford d simak as an early influence and said in  that his style had not changed asimov also enjoyed giving his longer stories complicated narrative structures often by arranging chapters in nonchronological ways some readers have been put off by this complaining that the nonlinearity is not worth the trouble and adversely affects the clarity of the story for example the first third of the gods themselves begins with chapter  then backtracks to fill in earlier material john campbell advised asimov to begin his stories as late in the plot as possible this advice helped asimov create reason one of the early robot stories patrouch found that the interwoven and nested flashbacks of the currents of space did serious harm to that novel to such an extent that only a dyedinthekyrt asimov fan could enjoy it in his later novel nemesis one group of characters lives in the present and another group starts in the past beginning  years earlier and gradually moving toward the time of the first group alien life asimov once explained that his reluctance to write about aliens came from an incident early in his career when astoundings editor john campbell rejected one of his science fiction stories because the alien characters were portrayed as superior to the humans the nature of the rejection led him to believe that campbell may have based his bias towards humans in stories on a realworld racial bias unwilling to write only weak alien races and concerned that a confrontation would jeopardize his and campbells friendship he decided he would not write about aliens at all nevertheless in response to these criticisms he wrote the gods themselves which contains aliens and alien sex the book won the nebula award for best novel in  and the hugo award for best novel in  asimov said that of all his writings he was most proud of the middle section of the gods themselves the part that deals with those themes in the hugo awardwinning novelette gold asimov describes an author based on himself who has one of his books the gods themselves adapted into a compudrama essentially photorealistic computer animation the director criticizes the fictionalized asimov gregory laborian for having an extremely nonvisual style making it difficult to adapt his work and the author explains that he relies on ideas and dialogue rather than description to get his points across romance and women in the early days of science fiction some authors and critics felt that the romantic elements were inappropriate in science fiction stories which were supposedly to be focused on science and technology isaac asimov was a supporter of this point of view expressed in his  letters to astounding where he described such elements as mush and slop to his dismay these letters were met with a strong opposition asimov attributed the lack of romance and sex in his fiction to the early imprinting from starting his writing career when he had never been on a date and didnt know anything about girls he was sometimes criticized for the general absence of sex and of extraterrestrial life in his science fiction he claimed he wrote the gods themselves  to respond to these criticisms which often came from new wave science fiction and often british writers the second part of three of the novel is set on an alien world with three sexes and the sexual behavior of these creatures is extensively depicted views there is a perennial question among readers as to whether the views contained in a story reflect the views of the author the answer is not necessarily and yet one ought to add another short phrase but usually religion asimov was an atheist and a humanist he did not oppose religious conviction in others but he frequently railed against superstitious and pseudoscientific beliefs that tried to pass themselves off as genuine science during his childhood his parents observed the traditions of orthodox judaism less stringently than they had in petrovichi they did not force their beliefs upon young isaac and he grew up without strong religious influences coming to believe that the torah represented hebrew mythology in the same way that the iliad recorded greek mythology when he was  he chose not to have a bar mitzvah as his books treasury of humor and asimov laughs again record asimov was willing to tell jokes involving god satan the garden of eden jerusalem and other religious topics expressing the viewpoint that a good joke can do more to provoke thought than hours of philosophical discussion for a brief while his father worked in the local synagogue to enjoy the familiar surroundings and as isaac put it shine as a learned scholar versed in the sacred writings this scholarship was a seed for his later authorship and publication of asimovs guide to the bible an analysis of the historic foundations for the old and new testaments for many years asimov called himself an atheist he considered the term somewhat inadequate as it described what he did not believe rather than what he did eventually he described himself as a humanist and considered that term more practical asimov continued to identify himself as a secular jew as stated in his introduction to jack danns anthology of jewish science fiction wandering stars i attend no services and follow no ritual and have never undergone that curious puberty rite the bar mitzvah it doesnt matter i am jewish when asked in an interview in  if he was an atheist asimov replied i am an atheist out and out it took me a long time to say it ive been an atheist for years and years but somehow i felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist because it assumed knowledge that one didnt have somehow it was better to say one was a humanist or an agnostic i finally decided that im a creature of emotion as well as of reason emotionally i am an atheist i dont have the evidence to prove that god doesnt exist but i so strongly suspect he doesnt that i dont want to waste my time likewise he said about religious education i would not be satisfied to have my kids choose to be religious without trying to argue them out of it just as i would not be satisfied to have them decide to smoke regularly or engage in any other practice i consider detrimental to mind or body in his last volume of autobiography asimov wrote if i were not an atheist i would believe in a god who would choose to save people on the basis of the totality of their lives and not the pattern of their words i think he would prefer an honest and righteous atheist to a tv preacher whose every word is god god god and whose every deed is foul foul foul the same memoir states his belief that hell is the drooling dream of a sadist crudely affixed to an allmerciful god if even human governments were willing to curtail cruel and unusual punishments wondered asimov why would punishment in the afterlife not be restricted to a limited term asimov rejected the idea that a human belief or action could merit infinite punishment if an afterlife existed he claimed the longest and most severe punishment would be reserved for those who slandered god by inventing hell asimov said about using religious motifs in his writing i tend to ignore religion in my own stories altogether except when i absolutely have to have it  and whenever i bring in a religious motif that religion is bound to seem vaguely christian because that is the only religion i know anything about even though it is not mine an unsympathetic reader might think that i am burlesquing christianity but i am not then too it is impossible to write science fiction and really ignore religion politics asimov became a staunch supporter of the democratic party during the new deal and thereafter remained a political liberal he was a vocal opponent of the vietnam war in the s and in a television interview during the early s he publicly endorsed george mcgovern he was unhappy about what he considered an irrationalist viewpoint taken by many radical political activists from the late s and onwards in his second volume of autobiography in joy still felt asimov recalled meeting the counterculture figure abbie hoffman asimovs impression was that the s counterculture heroes had ridden an emotional wave which in the end left them stranded in a nomans land of the spirit from which he wondered if they would ever return asimov vehemently opposed richard nixon considering him a crook and a liar he closely followed watergate and was pleased when the president was forced to resign asimov was dismayed over the pardon extended to nixon by his successor gerald ford i was not impressed by the argument that it has spared the nation an ordeal to my way of thinking the ordeal was necessary to make certain it would never happen again after asimovs name appeared in the mids on a list of people the communist party usa considered amenable to its goals the fbi investigated him because of his academic background the bureau briefly considered asimov as a possible candidate for known soviet spy robprof but found nothing suspicious in his life or background asimov appeared to hold an equivocal attitude towards israel in his first autobiography he indicates his support for the safety of israel though insisting that he was not a zionist in his third autobiography asimov stated his opposition to the creation of a jewish state on the grounds that he was opposed to having nationstates in general and supported the notion of a single humanity asimov especially worried about the safety of israel given that it had been created among muslim neighbors who will never forgive never forget and never go away and said that jews had merely created for themselves another jewish ghetto social issues asimov believed that science fiction  serves the good of humanity he considered himself a feminist even before womens liberation became a widespread movement he argued that the issue of womens rights was closely connected to that of population control furthermore he believed that homosexuality must be considered a moral right on population grounds as must all consenting adult sexual activity that does not lead to reproduction he issued many appeals for population control reflecting a perspective articulated by people from thomas malthus through paul r ehrlich in a  interview by bill moyers asimov proposed computeraided learning where people would use computers to find information on subjects in which they were interested he thought this would make learning more interesting since people would have the freedom to choose what to learn and would help spread knowledge around the world also the onetoone model would let students learn at their own pace asimov thought that people would live in space by  in  asimov wrote computerization will undoubtedly continue onward inevitably this means that a vast change in the nature of education must take place and entire populations must be made computerliterate and must be taught to deal with a hightech world he continues on education education which must be revolutionized in the new world will be revolutionized by the very agency that requires the revolution  the computer schools will undoubtedly still exist but a good schoolteacher can do no better than to inspire curiosity which an interested student can then satisfy at home at the console of his computer outlet there will be an opportunity finally for every youngster and indeed every person to learn what he or she wants to learn in his or her own time at his or her own speed in his or her own way education will become fun because it will bubble up from within and not be forced in from without sexual assault asimov would often fondle kiss and pinch women at conventions and elsewhere without regard for their consent according to alec nevalalee author of an asimov biography and writer on the history of science fiction he often defended himself by saying that far from showing objections these women cooperated in a  satirical piece the sensuous dirty old man asimov wrote the question then is not whether or not a girl should be touched the question is merely where when and how she should be touched according to nevalalee however many of these encounters were clearly nonconsensual he wrote that asimovs behavior as a leading sciencefiction author and personality contributed to an undesirable atmosphere for women in the maledominated science fiction community in support of this he quoted some of asimovs contemporary fellowauthors such as judith merril harlan ellison and frederik pohl as well as editors such as timothy seldes additional specific incidents were reported by other people including edward l ferman longtime editor of the magazine of fantasy  science fiction who wrote instead of shaking my dates hand he shook her left breast environment and population asimovs defense of civil applications of nuclear power even after the three mile island nuclear power plant incident damaged his relations with some of his fellow liberals in a letter reprinted in yours isaac asimov he states that although he would prefer living in no danger whatsoever to living near a nuclear reactor he would still prefer a home near a nuclear power plant to a slum on love canal or near a union carbide plant producing methyl isocyanate the latter being a reference to the bhopal disaster in the closing years of his life asimov blamed the deterioration of the quality of life that he perceived in new york city on the shrinking tax base caused by the middleclass flight to the suburbs though he continued to support high taxes on the middle class to pay for social programs his last nonfiction book our angry earth  cowritten with his longtime friend science fiction author frederik pohl deals with elements of the environmental crisis such as overpopulation oil dependence war global warming and the destruction of the ozone layer in response to being presented by bill moyers with the question what do you see happening to the idea of dignity to human species if this population growth continues at its present rate asimov responded its going to destroy it all  if you have  people in the apartment and two bathrooms no matter how much every person believes in freedom of the bathroom there is no such thing you have to set up you have to set up times for each person you have to bang at the door arent you through yet and so on and in the same way democracy cannot survive overpopulation human dignity cannot survive it convenience and decency cannot survive it as you put more and more people onto the world the value of life not only declines but it disappears other authors asimov enjoyed the writings of j r r tolkien and used the lord of the rings as a plot point in a black widowers story titled nothing like murder in the essay all or nothing for the magazine of fantasy and science fiction jan  asimov said that he admired tolkien and that he had read the lord of the rings five times the feelings were mutual with tolkien saying that he had enjoyed asimovs science fiction this would make asimov an exception to tolkiens earlier claim that he rarely found any modern books that were interesting to him he acknowledged other writers as superior to himself in talent saying of harlan ellison he is in my opinion one of the best writers in the world far more skilled at the art than i am asimov disapproved of the new waves growing influence stating in  i want science fiction i think science fiction isnt really science fiction if it lacks science and i think the better and truer the science the better and truer the science fiction the feelings of friendship and respect between asimov and arthur c clarke were demonstrated by the socalled clarkeasimov treaty of park avenue negotiated as they shared a cab in new york this stated that asimov was required to insist that clarke was the best science fiction writer in the world reserving secondbest for himself while clarke was required to insist that asimov was the best science writer in the world reserving secondbest for himself thus the dedication in clarkes book report on planet three  reads in accordance with the terms of the clarkeasimov treaty the secondbest science writer dedicates this book to the secondbest sciencefiction writer in  asimov wrote a highly critical review of george orwells  though dismissive of his attacks james machell has stated that they are easier to understand when you consider that asimov viewed  as dangerous literature he opines that if communism were to spread across the globe it would come in a completely different form to the one in  and by looking to orwell as an authority on totalitarianism we will be defending ourselves against assaults from the wrong direction and we will lose asimov became a fan of mystery stories at the same time as science fiction he preferred to read the former because i read every science fiction story keenly aware that it might be worse than mine in which case i had no patience with it or that it might be better in which case i felt miserable asimov wrote i make no secret of the fact that in my mysteries i use agatha christie as my model in my opinion her mysteries are the best ever written far better than the sherlock holmes stories and hercule poirot is the best detective fiction has seen why should i not use as my model what i consider the best he enjoyed sherlock holmes but considered arthur conan doyle to be a slapdash and sloppy writer asimov also enjoyed humorous stories particularly those of p g wodehouse in nonfiction writing asimov particularly admired the writing style of martin gardner and tried to emulate it in his own science books on meeting gardner for the first time in  asimov told him this to which gardner answered that he had based his own style on asimovs influence paul krugman holder of a nobel prize in economics stated asimovs concept of psychohistory inspired him to become an economist john jenkins who has reviewed the vast majority of asimovs written output once observed it has been pointed out that most science fiction writers since the s have been affected by asimov either modeling their style on his or deliberately avoiding anything like his style along with such figures as bertrand russell and karl popper asimov left his mark as one of the most distinguished interdisciplinarians of the th century few individuals writes james l christian understood better than isaac asimov what synoptic thinking is all about his almost  bookswhich he wrote as a specialist a knowledgeable authority or just an excited laymanrange over almost all conceivable subjects the sciences history literature religion and of course science fiction in  darpa named one of its programs after asimov inspired by his three laws of robotics the program autonomy standards and ideals with military operational values asimov aims to develop benchmarks objectively and quantitatively assessing the ethical challenges and readiness of utilizing autonomous systems for military operations
