in cryptography a cipher or cypher is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryptiona series of welldefined steps that can be followed as a procedure an alternative less common term is encipherment to encipher or encode is to convert information into cipher or code in common parlance cipher is synonymous with code as they are both a set of steps that encrypt a message however the concepts are distinct in cryptography especially classical cryptography codes generally substitute different length strings of characters in the output while ciphers generally substitute the same number of characters as are input a code maps one meaning with another words and phrases can be coded as letters or numbers codes typically have direct meaning from input to key codes primarily function to save time ciphers are algorithmic the given input must follow the ciphers process to be solved ciphers are commonly used to encrypt written information codes operated by substituting according to a large codebook which linked a random string of characters or numbers to a word or phrase for example uqjhse could be the code for proceed to the following coordinates when using a cipher the original information is known as plaintext and the encrypted form as ciphertext the ciphertext message contains all the information of the plaintext message but is not in a format readable by a human or computer without the proper mechanism to decrypt it the operation of a cipher usually depends on a piece of auxiliary information called a key or in traditional nsa parlance a cryptovariable the encrypting procedure is varied depending on the key which changes the detailed operation of the algorithm a key must be selected before using a cipher to encrypt a message with some exceptions such as rot and atbash most modern ciphers can be categorized in several ways by whether they work on blocks of symbols usually of a fixed size block ciphers or on a continuous stream of symbols stream ciphers by whether the same key is used for both encryption and decryption symmetric key algorithms or if a different key is used for each asymmetric key algorithms if the algorithm is symmetric the key must be known to the recipient and sender and to no one else if the algorithm is an asymmetric one the enciphering key is different from but closely related to the deciphering key if one key cannot be deduced from the other the asymmetric key algorithm has the publicprivate key property and one of the keys may be made public without loss of confidentiality etymology originating from the sanskrit word for zero  sunya via the arabic word  sifr the word cipher spread to europe as part of the arabic numeral system during the middle ages the roman numeral system lacked the concept of zero and this limited advances in mathematics in this transition the word was adopted into medieval latin as cifra and then into middle french as cifre this eventually led to the english word cipher also spelt cypher one theory for how the term came to refer to encoding is that the concept of zero was confusing to europeans and so the term came to refer to a message or communication that was not easily understood the term cipher was later also used to refer to any arabic digit or to calculation using them so encoding text in the form of arabic numerals is literally converting the text to ciphers versus codes in casual contexts code and cipher can typically be used interchangeably however the technical usages of the words refer to different concepts codes contain meaning words and phrases are assigned to numbers or symbols creating a shorter message an example of this is the commercial telegraph code which was used to shorten long telegraph messages which resulted from entering into commercial contracts using exchanges of telegrams another example is given by whole word ciphers which allow the user to replace an entire word with a symbol or character much like the way written japanese utilizes kanji meaning chinese characters in japanese characters to supplement the native japanese characters representing syllables an example using english language with kanji could be to replace the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog by the quick brown  jumps  the lazy  stenographers sometimes use specific symbols to abbreviate whole words ciphers on the other hand work at a lower level the level of individual letters small groups of letters or in modern schemes individual bits and blocks of bits some systems used both codes and ciphers in one system using superencipherment to increase the security in some cases the terms codes and ciphers are used synonymously with substitution and transposition respectively historically cryptography was split into a dichotomy of codes and ciphers while coding had its own terminology analogous to that of ciphers encoding codetext decoding and so on however codes have a variety of drawbacks including susceptibility to cryptanalysis and the difficulty of managing a cumbersome codebook because of this codes have fallen into disuse in modern cryptography and ciphers are the dominant technique types there are a variety of different types of encryption algorithms used earlier in the history of cryptography are substantially different from modern methods and modern ciphers can be classified according to how they operate and whether they use one or two keys historical the caesar cipher is one of the earliest known cryptographic systems julius caesar used a cipher that shifts the letters in the alphabet in place by three and wrapping the remaining letters to the front to write to marcus tullius cicero in approximately  bc historical pen and paper ciphers used in the past are sometimes known as classical ciphers they include simple substitution ciphers such as rot and transposition ciphers such as a rail fence cipher for example good dog can be encrypted as pllx xlp where l substitutes for o p for g and x for d in the message transposition of the letters good dog can result in dgogdoo these simple ciphers and examples are easy to crack even without plaintextciphertext pairs in the s the parliamentarian commander edward montagu nd earl of manchester developed ciphers to send coded messages to his allies during the english civil war the english theologian john wilkins published a book in  titled mercury or the secret and swift messenger and described a musical cipher wherein letters of the alphabet were substituted for music notes this species of melodic cipher was depicted in greater detail by author abraham rees in his book cyclopdia  simple ciphers were replaced by polyalphabetic substitution ciphers such as the vigenere which changed the substitution alphabet for every letter for example good dog can be encrypted as plsx twf where l s and w substitute for o with even a small amount of known or estimated plaintext simple polyalphabetic substitution ciphers and letter transposition ciphers designed for pen and paper encryption are easy to crack it is possible to create a secure pen and paper cipher based on a onetime pad but these have other disadvantages during the early twentieth century electromechanical machines were invented to do encryption and decryption using transposition polyalphabetic substitution and a kind of additive substitution in rotor machines several rotor disks provided polyalphabetic substitution while plug boards provided another substitution keys were easily changed by changing the rotor disks and the plugboard wires although these encryption methods were more complex than previous schemes and required machines to encrypt and decrypt other machines such as the british bombe were invented to crack these encryption methods modern modern encryption methods can be divided by two criteria by type of key used and by type of input data by type of key used ciphers are divided into symmetric key algorithms privatekey cryptography where one same key is used for encryption and decryption and asymmetric key algorithms publickey cryptography where two different keys are used for encryption and decryption in a symmetric key algorithm eg des and aes the sender and receiver must have a shared key set up in advance and kept secret from all other parties the sender uses this key for encryption and the receiver uses the same key for decryption the design of aes advanced encryption system was beneficial because it aimed to overcome the flaws in the design of the des data encryption standard aess designers claim that the common means of modern cipher cryptanalytic attacks are ineffective against aes due to its design structure ciphers can be distinguished into two types by the type of input data block ciphers which encrypt block of data of fixed size and stream ciphers which encrypt continuous streams of data key size and vulnerability in a pure mathematical attack ie lacking any other information to help break a cipher two factors above all count computational power available ie the computing power which can be brought to bear on the problem it is important to note that average performancecapacity of a single computer is not the only factor to consider an adversary can use multiple computers at once for instance to increase the speed of exhaustive search for a key ie brute force attack substantially key size ie the size of key used to encrypt a message as the key size increases so does the complexity of exhaustive search to the point where it becomes impractical to crack encryption directly since the desired effect is computational difficulty in theory one would choose an algorithm and desired difficulty level thus decide the key length accordingly claude shannon proved using information theory considerations that any theoretically unbreakable cipher must have keys which are at least as long as the plaintext and used only once onetime pad see also
