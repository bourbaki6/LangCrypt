century ad usually in the latinised form londinium modern scientific analyses of the name must account for the origins of the different forms that are found in early sources latin usually londinium old english usually lunden and welsh usually llundein with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages it is agreed that the name came into these languages from common brythonic recent work tends to reconstruct the lost celtic form of the name as londonjon or something similar this was then adapted into latin as londinium and borrowed into old english until  the name london applied officially only to the city of london but since then it has also referred to the county of london and to greater london history prehistory in  remains of a bronze age bridge were found on the south river thames foreshore upstream from vauxhall bridge two of the timbers were radiocarbon dated to  bc in  foundations of a large timber structure dated to  bc were found on the thames south foreshore downstream from vauxhall bridge both structures are on the south bank of the thames where the nowunderground river effra flows into the thames roman london despite the evidence of scattered brythonic settlements in the area the first major settlement was founded by the romans around ad  about  years after their invasion of ad  this only lasted until about ad  when the iceni tribe led by queen boudica stormed it and burnt it to the ground the next planned incarnation of londinium prospered superseding colchester as the principal city of the roman province of britannia in  at its height in the nd century roman london had a population of about  anglosaxon and vikingperiod london with the earlythcentury collapse of roman rule the walled city of londinium was effectively abandoned although roman civilisation continued around st martininthefields until about  from about  an anglosaxon settlement known as lundenwic developed slightly west of the old roman city by about  the city had become a major port again but there is little evidence of largescale production from the s repeated viking assaults brought decline three are recorded those in  and  succeeded while the last in  was rebuffed the vikings applied danelaw over much of eastern and northern england its boundary running roughly from london to chester as an area of political and geographical control imposed by the viking incursions formally agreed by the danish warlord named guthrum and the west saxon king alfred the great in  the anglosaxon chronicle records that alfred refounded london in  archaeological research shows this involved abandonment of lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old roman walls london then grew slowly until a dramatic increase in about  by the th century london was clearly the largest town in england westminster abbey rebuilt in romanesque style by king edward the confessor was one of the grandest churches in europe winchester had been the capital of anglosaxon england but from this time london became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war in the view of frank stenton it had the resources and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political selfconsciousness appropriate to a national capital middle ages after winning the battle of hastings william duke of normandy was crowned king of england as william i in the newly completed westminster abbey on christmas day  william built the tower of london the first of many such in england rebuilt in stone in the southeastern corner of the city to intimidate the inhabitants in  william ii began building westminster hall near the abbey it became the basis of a new palace of westminster in the th century the institutions of central government which had hitherto followed the royal english court around the country grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed for most purposes at westminster although the royal treasury came to rest in the tower of london while the city of westminster developed into a true governmental capital its distinct neighbour the city of london remained englands

nearby shores of the low countries yet english maritime enterprise hardly reached beyond the seas of northwestern europe the commercial route to the italian peninsula and the mediterranean sea was normally through antwerp and over the alps any ships passing through the strait of gibraltar to or from england were likely to be italian or ragusan the reopening of the netherlands to english shipping in january  spurred a burst of commercial activity the royal exchange was founded mercantilism grew and monopoly traders such as the east india company were founded as trade expanded to the

cause after an initial advance by the royalists in  culminating in the battles of brentford and turnham green london was surrounded by a defensive perimeter wall known as the lines of communication

england and the top subdivision covering most of the citys metropolis the city of london at its core once comprised the whole settlement but as its urban area grew the corporation of london resisted attempts to amalgamate the city with its suburbs causing london to be defined several ways forty per cent of greater london is covered by the london post town in which london forms part of postal addresses the london telephone area code  covers a larger area similar in size to greater london although some outer districts are excluded and some just outside included the greater london boundary has been aligned to the m motorway in places further urban expansion is now prevented by the metropolitan green belt although the builtup area extends beyond the boundary in places producing a separately defined greater london urban area beyond this is the vast london commuter belt greater london is split for some purposes into inner london and outer london and by the river thames into north and south with an informal central london area the coordinates of the nominal centre of london traditionally the original eleanor cross at charing cross near the junction of trafalgar square and whitehall are about n w status within london both the city of london and the city of westminster have city status the city of london and the remainder of greater london are both counties for the purposes of lieutenancies the area of greater london includes areas that are part of the historic counties of middlesex kent surrey essex and hertfordshire more recently greater london has been defined as a region of england and in this context is known as london it is the capital of the united kingdom and of england by convention rather than statute the capital of england was moved to london from winchester as the palace of westminster developed in the th and th centuries to become the permanent location of the royal court and thus the political capital of the nation topography greater london encompasses a total area of  square miles  km the extended area known as the london metropolitan region or the london metropolitan agglomeration comprises a total area of  square miles  km modern london stands on the thames its primary geographical feature a navigable river which crosses the city from the southwest to the east the thames valley is a flood plain surrounded by gently rolling hills including parliament hill addington hills and primrose hill historically london grew up at the lowest bridging point on the thames the thames was once a much broader shallower river with extensive marshlands at high tide its shores reached five times their present width since the victorian era the thames has been extensively embanked and many of its london tributaries now flow underground the thames is a tidal river and london is vulnerable to flooding the threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high water level caused by climate change and by the slow tilting of the british isles as a result of postglacial rebound climate london has a temperate oceanic climate koppen cfb rainfall records have been kept in the city since at least  when records began at kew at kew the most rainfall in one month is  inches  mm in november  and the least is  inches  mm in both december  and july  mile end also had  inches  mm in april  the wettest year

recently in summer  and with much drier than average conditions prevailing from may to december however the most consecutive days without rain was  days in the spring of  winters are generally cool with little temperature variation heavy snow is rare but snow usually falls at least once each winter spring and autumn can be pleasant as a large city london has a considerable urban heat island effect making the centre of london at times  c  f warmer than the suburbs and outskirts areas places within londons vast urban area are identified using area names such as mayfair southwark wembley and whitechapel these are either informal designations reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or former boroughs such names have remained in use through tradition each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character but without official boundaries since  greater london has been divided into  london

main northern part of the port of london and extensive industrial areas in the late th century deindustrialisation and the closure of the docks brought great hardship throughout the area many large brownfield areas now being redeveloped including london riverside and the lower lea valley which was developed into the olympic park for the  olympics and paralympics north london is situated north of the city of london with south london whose development started with the ancient borough of southwark at the southern end of london bridge occupying all of london south of the river thames architecture londons buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style partly because of their varying ages many grand houses and public buildings such as the national gallery are constructed from portland stone some areas of the city particularly those just west of the centre are characterised by white stucco or whitewashed buildings few structures in central london predate the great fire of  these being a few trace roman remains the tower of london and a few scattered tudor survivors in the city further out is for example the tudorperiod hampton court palace part of the varied architectural heritage are the thcentury churches by christopher wren neoclassical financial institutions such as the royal exchange and the bank of england to the earlythcentury old bailey

north of the forest a rare population of melanistic black fallow deer is also maintained at the deer sanctuary near theydon bois muntjac deer are also found in the forest while londoners are accustomed to wildlife such as birds and foxes sharing the city more recently urban deer have started becoming a regular feature and whole herds of fallow deer come into residential areas at night to
