world war i or the first world war  july    november  also known as the great war was a global conflict between two coalitions the allies or entente and the central powers major areas of conflict included europe and the middle east as well as parts of africa and the asiapacific the war saw important developments in weaponry including tanks aircraft artillery machine guns and chemical weapons one of the deadliest conflicts in history it resulted in an estimated  million military casualties and  million civilian deaths from warrelated causes and genocide the movement of large numbers of people was a major factor in the deadly spanish flu pandemic the causes of world war i included the rise of the german empire and decline of the ottoman empire which disturbed the longstanding balance of power in europe the exacerbation of imperial rivalries and an arms race between the great powers growing tensions in the balkans reached a breaking point on  june  when gavrilo princip a bosnian serb assassinated franz ferdinand the heir to the austrohungarian throne austriahungary blamed serbia and declared war on  july after russia mobilised in serbias defence germany declared war on russia and france who had an alliance the united kingdom entered the war after germany invaded belgium and the ottoman empire joined the central powers in november germanys strategy in  was to quickly defeat france before transferring its forces to the east but its advance was halted in september and by the end of the year the western front consisted of a nearcontinuous line of trenches from the english channel to switzerland the eastern front was more dynamic but neither side gained a decisive advantage despite costly offensives italy bulgaria romania greece and others entered the war from  onward major battles including those at verdun the somme and passchendaele failed to break the stalemate on the western front in april  the united states joined the allies after germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare against atlantic shipping later that year the bolsheviks seized power in russia in the october revolution soviet russia signed an armistice with the central powers in december followed by a separate peace in march  that month germany launched a spring offensive in the west which despite initial successes left the german army exhausted and demoralised the allied hundred days offensive beginning in august  caused a collapse of the german front line following the vardar offensive bulgaria signed an armistice in late september by early november the allies had signed armistices with the ottomans and with austriahungary leaving germany isolated facing a revolution at home kaiser wilhelm ii abdicated on  november and the war ended with the armistice of  november  the paris peace conference of  imposed settlements on the defeated powers under the treaty of versailles germany lost significant territories was disarmed and was required to pay large war reparations to the allies the dissolution of the russian german austrohungarian and ottoman empires led to new national boundaries and the creation of new independent states including poland finland the baltic states czechoslovakia and yugoslavia the league of nations was established to maintain world peace but its failure to manage instability during the interwar period contributed to the outbreak of world war ii in  names before world war ii the events of  were commonly referred to as the great war or simply the world war in august  the independent stated of the conflict this is the great war it names itself in the decade after its end many hoped it would be the war to end all wars because of its unprecedented destructiveness and death toll the earliest known use of the term first world war appeared in september  when german biologist and philosopher ernst haeckel wrote that the ongoing european war would become the first world war in the full sense of the word background political and military alliances for much of the th century the major european powers maintained a tenuous balance of power known as the concert of europe after  this was challenged by britains withdrawal into splendid isolation the decline of the ottoman empire new imperialism and the rise of prussia under otto von bismarck victory in the  francoprussian war allowed bismarck to consolidate a german empire after  french policy aimed to avenge this defeat and expand frances colonial empire in  bismarck negotiated the league of the three emperors which included austriahungary russia and germany after the  russoturkish war the league was dissolved due to austrian concerns over the expansion of russian influence in the balkans an area they considered to be of vital strategic interest germany and austriahungary then formed the  dual alliance which became the triple alliance when italy joined in  for bismarck the purpose of these agreements was to isolate france by ensuring the three empires resolved any disputes among themselves in  bismarck set up the reinsurance treaty a secret agreement between germany and russia to remain neutral if either were attacked by france or austriahungary for bismarck peace with russia was the foundation of german foreign policy but in  he was forced to retire by wilhelm ii the latter was persuaded not to renew the reinsurance treaty by his new chancellor leo von caprivi this gave france an opening to agree to the francorussian alliance in  which was then followed by the  entente cordiale with britain the triple entente was completed by the  anglorussian convention while not formal alliances by settling longstanding colonial disputes in asia and africa british support for france or russia in any future conflict became a possibility this was accentuated by british and russian support for france against germany during the  agadir crisis arms race german economic and industrial strength continued to expand rapidly post backed by wilhelm ii admiral alfred von tirpitz sought to use this growth to build an imperial german navy that could compete with the british royal navy this policy was based on the work of us naval author alfred thayer mahan who argued that possession of a bluewater navy was vital for global power projection tirpitz had his books translated into german while wilhelm made them required reading for his advisors and senior military personnel bismarck opposed any attempt to compete with the royal navy since he believed britain would not interfere in europe as long as its maritime supremacy remained secure his dismissal in  led to a change in policy and the start of an anglogerman naval arms race despite the vast sums spent by tirpitz the launch of hms dreadnought in  made every existing battleship obsolete and gave the british a technological advantage they never relinquished ultimately germany invested huge resources on creating a navy large enough to antagonise britain but not defeat it in  chancellor theobald von bethmann hollweg acknowledged defeat leading to the rustungswende or armaments turning point when he switched expenditure from the navy to the army this decision was driven by german concerns over the speed of russias recovery from defeat in the russojapanese war and the subsequent  russian revolution economic reforms led to a significant post expansion of railways and transportation infrastructure particularly in its western border regions since germany and austriahungary relied on faster mobilisation to compensate for their numerical inferiority compared to russia the threat posed by the closing of this gap was more important than competing with the royal navy after germany expanded its standing army by  troops in  france extended compulsory military service from two to three years sparking similar measures from the balkan powers italy the ottoman empire and austriahungary absolute figures are difficult to calculate due to differences in categorising expenditure since they often omit civilian infrastructure projects like railways which had logistical importance and military use however from  to  military spending by the six major european powers increased by over  in real terms conflicts in the balkans the years before  were marked by a series of crises in the balkans as other powers sought to benefit from the ottoman decline while panslavic and orthodox russia considered itself the protector of serbia and other slav states they preferred the strategically vital bosporus straits to be controlled by a weak ottoman government rather than an ambitious slav power like bulgaria russia had ambitions in northeastern anatolia while its clients had overlapping claims in the balkans these competing interests divided russian policymakers and added to regional instability austrian statesmen viewed the balkans as essential for the continued existence of their empire and saw serbian expansion as a direct threat the  bosnian crisis began when austria annexed the former ottoman territory of bosnia and herzegovina which it had occupied since  timed to coincide with the bulgarian declaration of independence from the ottoman empire this unilateral action was denounced by the european powers but accepted as there was no consensus on how to resolve the situation some historians see this as a significant escalation ending any chance of austria cooperating with russia in the balkans while also damaging diplomatic relations between serbia and italy tensions increased after the  italoturkish war demonstrated ottoman weakness and led to the formation of the balkan league an alliance of serbia bulgaria montenegro and greece the league quickly overran most of the ottomans territory in the balkans during the  first balkan war much to the surprise of outside observers the serbian capture of ports on the adriatic resulted in partial austrian mobilisation starting on  november  including units along the russian border in galicia the russian government decided not to mobilise in response unprepared to precipitate a war the great powers sought to reassert control through the  treaty of london which had created an independent albania while enlarging the territories of bulgaria serbia montenegro and greece however disputes between the victors sparked the day second balkan war when bulgaria attacked serbia and greece on  june  it was defeated losing most of macedonia to serbia and greece and southern dobruja to romania the result was that even countries which benefited from the balkan wars such as serbia and greece felt cheated of their rightful gains while for austria it demonstrated the apparent indifference with which other powers viewed their concerns including germany this complex mix of resentment nationalism and insecurity helps explain why the pre balkans became known as the powder keg of europe prelude sarajevo assassination on  june  archduke franz ferdinand of austria heir presumptive to emperor franz joseph i of austria visited sarajevo the capital of the recently annexed bosnia and herzegovina cvjetko popovic gavrilo princip nedeljko cabrinovic trifko grabez vaso cubrilovic bosnian serbs and muhamed mehmedbasic from the bosniaks community from the movement known as young bosnia took up positions along the archdukes motorcade route to assassinate him supplied with arms by extremists within the serbian black hand intelligence organisation they hoped his death would free bosnia from austrian rule cabrinovic threw a grenade at the archdukes car and injured two of his aides the other assassins were also unsuccessful an hour later as ferdinand was returning from visiting the injured officers in hospital his car took a wrong turn into a street where gavrilo princip was standing he fired two pistol shots fatally wounding ferdinand and his wife sophie according to historian zbynek zeman in vienna the event almost failed to make any impression whatsoever on  and  june the crowds listened to music and drank wine as if nothing had happened nevertheless the impact of the murder of the heir to the throne was significant and has been described by historian christopher clark as a  effect a terrorist event charged with historic meaning transforming the political chemistry in vienna expansion of violence in bosnia and herzegovina austrohungarian authorities encouraged subsequent antiserb riots in sarajevo violent actions against ethnic serbs were also organised outside sarajevo in other cities in austrohungariancontrolled bosnia and herzegovina croatia and slovenia austrohungarian authorities in bosnia and herzegovina imprisoned approximately  prominent serbs  to  of whom died in prison a further  serbs were sentenced to death a predominantly bosniak special militia known as the schutzkorps was established and carried out the persecution of serbs july crisis the assassination initiated the july crisis a month of diplomatic manoeuvring among austriahungary germany russia france and britain believing that serbian intelligence helped organise franz ferdinands murder austrian officials wanted to use the opportunity to end serbian interference in bosnia and saw war as the best way of achieving this however the foreign ministry had no solid proof of serbian involvement on  july austria delivered an ultimatum to serbia listing ten demands made intentionally unacceptable to provide an excuse for starting hostilities serbia ordered general mobilisation on  july but accepted all the terms except for those empowering austrian representatives to suppress subversive elements inside serbia and take part in the investigation and trial of serbians linked to the assassination claiming this amounted to rejection austria broke off diplomatic relations and ordered partial mobilisation the next day on  july they declared war on serbia and began shelling belgrade russia ordered general mobilisation in support of serbia on  july anxious to ensure backing from the spd political opposition by presenting russia as the aggressor german chancellor bethmann hollweg delayed the commencement of war preparations until  july that afternoon the russian government were handed a note requiring them to cease all war measures against germany and austriahungary within  hours a further german demand for neutrality was refused by the french who ordered general mobilisation but delayed declaring war the german general staff had long assumed they faced a war on two fronts the schlieffen plan envisaged using  of the army to defeat france then switching to russia since this required them to move quickly mobilisation orders were issued that afternoon once the german ultimatum to russia expired on the morning of  august the two countries were at war at a meeting on  july the british cabinet had narrowly decided its obligations to belgium under the  treaty of london did not require it to oppose a german invasion with military force however prime minister asquith and his senior cabinet ministers were already committed to supporting france the royal navy had been mobilised and public opinion was strongly in favour of intervention on  july britain sent notes to germany and france asking them to respect belgian neutrality france pledged to do so but germany did not reply aware of german plans to attack through belgium french commanderinchief joseph joffre asked his government for permission to cross the border and preempt such a move to avoid violating belgian neutrality he was told any advance could come only after a german invasion instead the french cabinet ordered its army to withdraw  km behind the german frontier to avoid provoking war on  august germany occupied luxembourg and exchanged fire with french units when german patrols entered french territory on  august they declared war on france and demanded free passage across belgium which was refused early on the morning of  august the germans invaded and albert i of belgium called for assistance under the treaty of london britain sent germany an ultimatum demanding they withdraw from belgium when this expired at midnight without a response the two empires were at war progress of the war opening hostilities confusion among the central powers germany promised to support austriahungarys invasion of serbia but interpretations of what this meant differed previously tested deployment plans had been replaced early in  but those had never been tested in exercises austrohungarian leaders believed germany would cover its northern flank against russia serbian campaign beginning on  august the austrians and serbs clashed at the battles of the cer and kolubara over the next two weeks austrian attacks were repulsed with heavy losses as a result austria had to keep sizeable forces on the serbian front weakening their efforts against russia serbias victory against austriahungary in the  invasion has been called one of the major upset victories of the twentieth century in  the campaign saw the first use of antiaircraft warfare after an austrian plane was shot down with groundtoair fire as well as the first medical evacuation by the serbian army german offensive in belgium and france upon mobilisation in accordance with the schlieffen plan  of the german army was located on the western front with the remainder acting as a screening force in the east rather than a direct attack across their shared frontier the german right wing would sweep through the netherlands and belgium then swing south encircling paris and trapping the french army against the swiss border the plans creator alfred von schlieffen head of the german general staff from  to  estimated that this would take six weeks after which the german army would transfer to the east and defeat the russians the plan was substantially modified by his successor helmuth von moltke the younger under schlieffen  of german forces in the west were assigned to the right wing with the remainder holding along the frontier by keeping his leftwing deliberately weak he hoped to lure the french into an offensive into the lost provinces of alsacelorraine which was the strategy envisaged by their plan xvii however moltke grew concerned that the french might push too hard on his left flank and as the german army increased in size from  to  he changed the allocation of forces between the two wings to  he also considered dutch neutrality essential for german trade and cancelled the incursion into the netherlands which meant any delays in belgium threatened the viability of the plan historian richard holmes argues that these changes meant the right wing was not strong enough to achieve decisive success the initial german advance in the west was very successful by the end of august the allied left which included the british expeditionary force bef was in full retreat and the french offensive in alsacelorraine was a disastrous failure with casualties exceeding  german planning provided broad strategic instructions while allowing army commanders considerable freedom in carrying them out at the front but alexander von kluck used this freedom to disobey orders opening a gap between the german armies as they closed on paris the french army reinforced by the british expeditionary corps seized this opportunity to counterattack and pushed the german army  to  km back both armies were then so exhausted that no decisive move could be implemented so they settled in trenches with the vain hope of breaking through as soon as they could build local superiority in  the russian stavka agreed with the french to attack germany within fifteen days of mobilisation ten days before the germans had anticipated although it meant the two russian armies that entered east prussia on  august did so without many of their support elements by the end of  german troops held strong defensive positions inside france controlled the bulk of frances domestic coalfields and inflicted  more casualties than it lost itself however communications problems and questionable command decisions cost germany the chance of a decisive outcome while it had failed to achieve the primary objective of avoiding a long twofront war as was apparent to several german leaders this amounted to a strategic defeat shortly after the first battle of the marne crown prince wilhelm told an american reporter we have lost the war it will go on for a long time but lost it is already asia and the pacific on  august  new zealand occupied german samoa now samoa on  september the australian naval and military expeditionary force landed on the island of new britain then part of german new guinea on  october the german cruiser sms emden sank the russian cruiser zhemchug in the battle of penang japan declared war on germany before seizing territories in the pacific which later became the south seas mandate as well as german treaty ports on the chinese shandong peninsula at tsingtao after vienna refused to withdraw its cruiser sms kaiserin elisabeth from tsingtao japan declared war on austriahungary and the ship was scuttled in november  within a few months allied forces had seized all german territories in the pacific leaving only isolated commerce raiders and a few holdouts in new guinea african campaigns some of the first clashes of the war involved british french and german colonial forces in africa on  august french and british troops invaded the german protectorates of togoland and kamerun on  august german forces in southwest africa attacked south africa sporadic and fierce fighting continued for the rest of the war the german colonial forces in german east africa led by colonel paul von lettowvorbeck fought a guerrilla warfare campaign and only surrendered two weeks after the armistice took effect in europe indian support for the allies before the war germany had attempted to use indian nationalism and panislamism to its advantage a policy continued post by instigating uprisings in india while the niedermayerhentig expedition urged afghanistan to join the war on the side of central powers however contrary to british fears of a revolt in india the outbreak of the war saw a reduction in nationalist activity leaders from the indian national congress and other groups believed support for the british war effort would hasten indian home rule a promise allegedly made explicit in  by edwin montagu the secretary of state for india in  the british indian army was larger than the british army itself and between  and  an estimated  million indian soldiers and labourers served in europe africa and the middle east in all  soldiers served on the western front and nearly  in the middle east with  killed and  wounded the suffering engendered by the war as well as the failure of the british government to grant selfgovernment to india afterward bred disillusionment resulting in the campaign for full independence led by mahatma gandhi western front trench warfare begins prewar military tactics that had emphasised open warfare and individual riflemen proved obsolete when confronted with conditions prevailing in  technological advances allowed the creation of strong defensive systems largely impervious to massed infantry advances such as barbed wire machine guns and above all far more powerful artillery which dominated the battlefield and made crossing open ground extremely difficult both sides struggled to develop tactics for breaching entrenched positions without heavy casualties in time technology enabled the production of new offensive weapons such as gas warfare and the tank after the first battle of the marne in september  allied and german forces unsuccessfully tried to outflank each other a series of manoeuvres later known as the race to the sea by the end of  the opposing forces confronted each other along an uninterrupted line of entrenched positions from the channel to the swiss border since the germans were normally able to choose where to stand they generally held the high ground while their trenches tended to be better built those constructed by the french and english were initially considered temporary only needed until an offensive would destroy the german defences both sides tried to break the stalemate using scientific and technological advances on  april  at the second battle of ypres the germans violating the hague convention used chlorine gas for the first time on the western front continuation of trench warfare in february  the germans attacked french defensive positions at the battle of verdun lasting until december  casualties were greater for the french but the germans bled heavily as well with anywhere from  to  casualties between the two combatants verdun became a symbol of french determination and selfsacrifice the battle of the somme was an anglofrench offensive from july to november  the opening day on  july  was the bloodiest single day in the history of the british army which suffered  casualties including  dead as a whole the somme offensive led to an estimated  british casualties along with  french and  germans the diseases that emerged in the trenches were a major killer on both sides the living conditions led to disease and infection such as trench foot lice typhus trench fever and the spanish flu naval war at the start of the war german cruisers were scattered across the globe some of which were subsequently used to attack allied merchant shipping these were systematically hunted down by the royal navy though not before causing considerable damage one of the most successful was the sms emden part of the german east asia squadron stationed at qingdao which seized or sank  merchantmen a russian cruiser and a french destroyer most of the squadron was returning to germany when it sank two british armoured cruisers at the battle of coronel in november  before being virtually destroyed at the battle of the falkland islands in december the sms dresden escaped with a few auxiliaries but after the battle of mas a tierra these too were either destroyed or interned soon after the outbreak of hostilities britain began a naval blockade of germany this proved effective in cutting off vital supplies though it violated accepted international law britain also mined international waters which closed off entire sections of the ocean even to neutral ships since there was limited response to this tactic germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare the battle of jutland in mayjune  was the only fullscale clash of battleships during the war and one of the largest in history the clash was indecisive though the germans inflicted more damage than they received thereafter the bulk of the german high seas fleet was confined to port german uboats attempted to cut the supply lines between north america and britain the nature of submarine warfare meant that attacks often came without warning giving the crews of the merchant ships little hope of survival the united states launched a protest and germany changed its rules of engagement after the sinking of the passenger ship rms lusitania in  germany promised not to target passenger liners while britain armed its merchant ships placing them beyond the protection of the cruiser rules which demanded warning and movement of crews to a place of safety a standard that lifeboats did not meet finally in early  germany adopted a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare realising the americans would eventually enter the war germany sought to strangle allied sea lanes before the united states could transport a large army overseas but after initial successes eventually failed to do so the uboat threat lessened in  when merchant ships began travelling in convoys escorted by destroyers this tactic made it difficult for uboats to find targets which significantly lessened losses after the hydrophone and depth charges were introduced destroyers could potentially successfully attack a submerged submarine convoys slowed the flow of supplies since ships had to wait as convoys were assembled the solution was an extensive program of building new freighters troopships were too fast for the submarines and did not travel the north atlantic in convoys the uboats sunk more than  allied ships at the cost of  submarines world war i also saw the first use of aircraft carriers in combat with hms furious launching sopwith camels in a successful raid against the zeppelin hangars at tondern in july  as well as blimps for antisubmarine patrol southern theatres war in the balkans faced with russia in the east austriahungary could spare only onethird of its army to attack serbia after suffering heavy losses the austrians briefly occupied the serbian capital belgrade a serbian counterattack in the battle of kolubara succeeded in driving them from the country by the end of  for the first  months of  austriahungary used most of its military reserves to fight italy german and austrohungarian diplomats scored a coup by persuading bulgaria to join the attack on serbia the austrohungarian provinces of slovenia croatia and bosnia provided troops for austriahungary montenegro allied itself with serbia bulgaria declared war on serbia on  october  and joined in the attack by the austrohungarian army under mackensens army of  that was already underway serbia was conquered in a little more than a month as the central powers now including bulgaria sent in  troops in total the serbian army fighting on two fronts and facing certain defeat retreated into northern albania the serbs suffered defeat in the battle of kosovo montenegro covered the serbian retreat toward the adriatic coast in the battle of mojkovac on  january  but ultimately the austrians also conquered montenegro the surviving serbian soldiers were evacuated to greece after the conquest serbia was divided between austrohungary and bulgaria in late  a francobritish force landed at salonica in greece to offer assistance and to pressure its government to declare war against the central powers however the progerman king constantine i dismissed the proallied government of eleftherios venizelos before the allied expeditionary force arrived the macedonian front was at first mostly static french and serbian forces retook limited areas of macedonia by recapturing bitola on  november  following the costly monastir offensive which brought stabilisation of the front serbian and french troops finally made a breakthrough in september  in the vardar offensive after most german and austrohungarian troops had been withdrawn the bulgarians were defeated at the battle of dobro pole and by  september british and french troops had crossed the border into bulgaria proper as the bulgarian army collapsed bulgaria capitulated four days later on  september  the german high command responded by despatching troops to hold the line but these forces were too weak to reestablish a front the allied breakthrough on the macedonian front cut communications between the ottoman empire and the other central powers and made vienna vulnerable to attack hindenburg and ludendorff concluded that the strategic and operational balance had now shifted decidedly against the central powers and a day after the bulgarian collapse insisted on an immediate peace settlement ottoman empire the ottomans threatened russias caucasian territories and britains communications with india via the suez canal the ottoman empire took advantage of the european powers preoccupation with the war and conducted largescale ethnic cleansing of the armenian greek and assyrian christian populationsthe armenian genocide greek genocide and assyrian genocide respectively the british and french opened overseas fronts with the gallipoli  and mesopotamian campaigns  in gallipoli the ottoman empire successfully repelled the british french and australian and new zealand army corps anzacs in mesopotamia by contrast after the defeat of the british defenders in the siege of kut by the ottomans  british imperial forces reorganised and captured baghdad in march  the british were aided in mesopotamia by local arab and assyrian fighters while the ottomans employed local kurdish and turcoman tribes the suez canal was defended from ottoman attacks in  and  in august  a german and ottoman force was defeated at the battle of romani by the anzac mounted division and the nd lowland infantry division following this victory an egyptian expeditionary force advanced across the sinai peninsula pushing ottoman forces back in the battle of magdhaba in december and the battle of rafa on the border between the egyptian sinai and ottoman palestine in january  russian armies generally had success in the caucasus campaign enver pasha supreme commander of the ottoman armed forces dreamed of reconquering central asia and areas that had been previously lost to russia he was however a poor commander he launched an offensive against the russians in the caucasus in december  with  troops insisting on a frontal attack against mountainous russian positions in winter he lost  of his force at the battle of sarikamish general nikolai yudenich the russian commander from  to  drove the turks out of most of the southern caucasus the ottoman empire with german support invaded persia modern iran in december  to cut off british and russian access to petroleum reservoirs around baku persia ostensibly neutral had long been under british and russian influence the ottomans and germans were aided by kurdish and azeri forces together with a large number of major iranian tribes while the russians and british had the support of armenian and assyrian forces the persian campaign lasted until  and ended in failure for the ottomans and their allies however the russian withdrawal from the war in  led armenian and assyrian forces to be cut off from supply lines outnumbered outgunned and isolated forcing them to fight and flee towards british lines in northern mesopotamia the arab revolt instigated by the british foreign office started in june  with the battle of mecca led by sharif hussein the sharif declared the independence of the kingdom of hejaz and with british assistance conquered much of ottomanheld arabia resulting finally in the ottoman surrender of damascus fakhri pasha the ottoman commander of medina resisted for more than  years during the siege of medina before surrendering in january  the senussi tribe along the border of italian libya and british egypt incited and armed by the turks waged a smallscale guerrilla war against allied troops the british were forced to dispatch  troops to oppose them in the senussi campaign their rebellion was finally crushed in mid total allied casualties on the ottoman fronts amounted to  men total ottoman casualties were  with  dead and  wounded italian front though italy joined the triple alliance in  a treaty with its traditional austrian enemy was so controversial that subsequent governments denied its existence and the terms were only made public in  this arose from nationalist designs on austrohungarian territory in trentino the austrian littoral rijeka and dalmatia considered vital to secure the borders established in  in  rome secretly had agreed with france to remain neutral if the latter was attacked by germany effectively nullifying its role in the triple alliance when the war began in  italy argued the triple alliance was defensive and it was not obliged to support an austrian attack on serbia opposition to joining the central powers increased when turkey became a member in september since in  italy had occupied ottoman possessions in libya and the dodecanese islands to secure italian neutrality the central powers offered them tunisia while in return for an immediate entry into the war the allies agreed to their demands for austrian territory and sovereignty over the dodecanese although they remained secret these provisions were incorporated into the april  treaty of london and italy joined the allies on  may italy declared war on austriahungary and on germany fifteen months later the pre italian army was short of officers trained men adequate transport and modern weapons by april  some of these deficiencies had been remedied but it was still unprepared for the major offensive required by the treaty of london the advantage of superior numbers was offset by the difficult terrain much of the fighting took place high in the alps and dolomites where trench lines had to be cut through rock and ice and keeping troops supplied was a major challenge these issues were exacerbated by unimaginative strategies and tactics between  and  the italian commander luigi cadorna undertook a series of frontal assaults along the isonzo which made little progress and cost many lives by the end of the war italian combat deaths totalled around  in the spring of  the austrohungarians counterattacked in asiago in the strafexpedition but made little progress and were pushed by the italians back to tyrol although italy occupied southern albania in may  their main focus was the isonzo front which after the capture of gorizia in august  remained static until october  after a combined austrogerman force won a major victory at caporetto cadorna was replaced by armando diaz who retreated more than  kilometres  mi before holding positions along the piave river a second austrian offensive was repulsed in june  on  october diaz launched the battle of vittorio veneto and initially met stubborn resistance but with austriahungary collapsing hungarian divisions in italy demanded they be sent home when this was granted many others followed and the imperial army disintegrated the italians taking over  prisoners on  november the armistice of villa giusti ended hostilities between austriahungary and italy which occupied trieste and areas along the adriatic sea awarded to it in  eastern front initial actions as previously agreed with french president raymond poincare russian plans at the start of the war were to simultaneously advance into austrian galicia and east prussia as soon as possible although their attack on galicia was largely successful and the invasions achieved their aim of forcing germany to divert troops from the western front the speed of mobilisation meant they did so without much of their heavy equipment and support functions these weaknesses contributed to russian defeats at tannenberg and the masurian lakes in august and september  forcing them to withdraw from east prussia with heavy losses by spring  they had also retreated from galicia and the may  gorlicetarnow offensive allowed the central powers to invade russianoccupied poland despite the successful june  brusilov offensive against the austrians in eastern galicia shortages of supplies heavy losses and command failures prevented the russians from fully exploiting their victory however it was one of the most significant offensives of the war diverting german resources from verdun relieving austrohungarian pressure on the italians and convincing romania to enter the war on the side of the allies on  august it also fatally weakened both the austrian and russian armies whose offensive capabilities were badly affected by their losses and increased disillusion with the war that ultimately led to the russian revolutions meanwhile unrest grew in russia as tsar nicholas ii remained at the front with the home front controlled by empress alexandra her increasingly incompetent rule and food shortages in urban areas led to widespread protests and the murder of her favourite grigori rasputin at the end of  romanian participation despite secretly agreeing to support the triple alliance in  romania increasingly found itself at odds with the central powers over their support for bulgaria in the balkan wars and the status of ethnic romanian communities in hungariancontrolled transylvania which comprised an estimated  million of the regions  million population with the ruling elite split into progerman and proentente factions romania remained neutral for two years while allowing germany and austria to transport military supplies and advisors across romanian territory in september  russia acknowledged romanian rights to austrohungarian territories including transylvania and banat whose acquisition had widespread popular support and russian success against austria led romania to join the entente in the august  treaty of bucharest under the strategic plan known as hypothesis z the romanian army planned an offensive into transylvania while defending southern dobruja and giurgiu against a possible bulgarian counterattack on  august  they attacked transylvania and occupied substantial parts of the province before being driven back by the recently formed german th army led by former chief of staff erich von falkenhayn a combined germanbulgarianturkish offensive captured dobruja and giurgiu although the bulk of the romanian army managed to escape encirclement and retreated to bucharest which surrendered to the central powers on  december  in the summer of  a central powers offensive began in romania under the command of august von mackensen to knock romania out of the war resulting in the battles of oituz marasti and marasesti where up to  central powers troops were present the battles lasted from  july to  september and eventually the romanian army was victorious advancing  km august von mackensen could not plan for another offensive as he had to transfer troops to the italian front following the russian revolution romania found itself alone on the eastern front and signed the treaty of bucharest with the central powers which recognised romanian sovereignty over bessarabia in return for ceding control of passes in the carpathian mountains to austriahungary and leasing its oil wells to germany although approved by parliament king ferdinand i refused to sign it hoping for an allied victory in the west romania reentered the war on  november  on the side of the allies and the treaty of bucharest was formally annulled by the armistice of  november  central powers peace overtures on  december  after ten brutal months of the battle of verdun and a successful offensive against romania germany attempted to negotiate a peace with the allies however this attempt was rejected out of hand as a duplicitous war ruse us president woodrow wilson attempted to intervene as a peacemaker asking for both sides to state their demands lloyd georges war cabinet considered the german offer to be a ploy to create divisions among the allies after initial outrage and much deliberation they took wilsons note as a separate effort signalling that the us was on the verge of entering the war against germany following the submarine outrages while the allies debated a response to wilsons offer the germans chose to rebuff it in favour of a direct exchange of views learning of the german response the allied governments were free to make clear demands in their response of  january they sought restoration of damages the evacuation of occupied territories reparations for france russia and romania and a recognition of the principle of nationalities the allies sought guarantees that would prevent or limit future wars the negotiations failed and the entente powers rejected the german offer on the grounds of honour and noted germany had not put forward any specific proposals final years of the war russian revolution and withdrawal by the end of  russian casualties totalled nearly five million killed wounded or captured with major urban areas affected by food shortages and high prices in march  tsar nicholas ordered the military to forcibly suppress strikes in petrograd but the troops refused to fire on the crowds revolutionaries set up the petrograd soviet and fearing a leftwing takeover the state duma forced nicholas to abdicate and established the russian provisional government which confirmed russias willingness to continue the war however the petrograd soviet refused to disband creating competing power centres and causing confusion and chaos with frontline soldiers becoming increasingly demoralised following the tsars abdication vladimir leninwith the help of the german governmentwas ushered from switzerland into russia on  april  discontent and the weaknesses of the provisional government led to a rise in the popularity of the bolshevik party led by lenin which demanded an immediate end to the war the revolution of november was followed in december by an armistice and negotiations with germany at first the bolsheviks refused the german terms but when german troops began marching across ukraine unopposed they acceded to the treaty of brestlitovsk on  march  the treaty ceded vast territories including finland estonia latvia lithuania and parts of poland and ukraine to the central powers with the russian empire out of the war romania found itself alone on the eastern front and signed the treaty of bucharest with the central powers in may  under the terms of the treaty romania ceded territory to austriahungary and bulgaria and leased its oil reserves to germany however the terms also included the central powers recognition of the union of bessarabia with romania united states enters the war the united states was a major supplier of war material to the allies but remained neutral in  in large part due to domestic opposition the most significant factor in creating the support wilson needed was the german submarine offensive which not only cost american lives but paralysed trade as ships were reluctant to put to sea on  april  congress declared war on germany as an associated power of the allies the us navy sent a battleship group to scapa flow to join the grand fleet and provided convoy escorts in april  the us army had fewer than  men including national guard units compared to british and french armies of  and  million respectively the selective service act of  drafted  million men though training and equipping such numbers was a huge logistical challenge by june  over  members of the american expeditionary forces aef were transported to france a figure which reached  million by the end of november despite his conviction that germany must be defeated wilson went to war to ensure the us played a leading role in shaping the peace which meant preserving the aef as a separate military force rather than being absorbed into british or french units as his allies wanted he was strongly supported by aef commander general john j pershing a proponent of pre open warfare who considered the french and british emphasis on artillery misguided and incompatible with american offensive spirit much to the frustration of his allies who had suffered heavy losses in  he insisted on retaining control of american troops and refused to commit them to the front line until able to operate as independent units as a result the first significant us involvement was the meuseargonne offensive in late september  nivelle offensive aprilmay  in december  robert nivelle replaced petain as commander of french armies on the western front and began planning a spring attack in champagne part of a joint francobritish operation poor security meant german intelligence was well informed on tactics and timetables but despite this when the attack began on  april the french made substantial gains before being brought to a halt by the newly built and extremely strong defences of the hindenburg line nivelle persisted with frontal assaults and by  april the french had suffered nearly  casualties including  dead most incurred in the first two days concurrent british attacks at arras were more successful though ultimately of little strategic value operating as a separate unit for the first time the canadian corps capture of vimy ridge is viewed by many canadians as a defining moment in creating a sense of national identity though nivelle continued the offensive on  may the st division which had been involved in some of the heaviest fighting at verdun refused orders to go into battle initiating the french army mutinies within days collective indiscipline had spread to  divisions while over  deserted sinai and palestine campaign  in march and april  at the first and second battles of gaza german and ottoman forces stopped the advance of the egyptian expeditionary force which had begun in august  at the battle of romani at the end of october  the sinai and palestine campaign resumed when general edmund allenbys xxth corps xxi corps and desert mounted corps won the battle of beersheba two ottoman armies were defeated a few weeks later at the battle of mughar ridge and early in december jerusalem had been captured following another ottoman defeat at the battle of jerusalem about this time friedrich freiherr kress von kressenstein was relieved of his duties as the eighth armys commander replaced by djevad pasha and a few months later the commander of the ottoman army in palestine erich von falkenhayn was replaced by otto liman von sanders in early  the front line was extended and the jordan valley was occupied following the first transjordan and the second transjordan attacks by british empire forces in march and april  german offensive and allied counteroffensive marchnovember  in december  the central powers signed an armistice with russia thus freeing large numbers of german troops for use in the west with german reinforcements and new american troops pouring in the outcome was to be decided on the western front the central powers knew that they could not win a protracted war but they held high hopes for success in a final quick offensive ludendorff drew up plans operation michael for the  offensive on the western front the operation commenced on  march  with an attack on british forces near saintquentin german forces achieved an unprecedented advance of  kilometres  mi the initial offensive was a success after heavy fighting however the offensive was halted lacking tanks or motorised artillery the germans were unable to consolidate their gains the problems of resupply were also exacerbated by increasing distances that now stretched over terrain that was shelltorn and often impassable to traffic germany launched operation georgette against the northern english channel ports the allies halted the drive after limited territorial gains by germany the german army to the south then conducted operations blucher and yorck pushing broadly towards paris germany launched operation marne second battle of the marne on  july in an attempt to encircle reims the resulting counterattack which started the hundred days offensive on  august led to a marked collapse in german morale allied advance to the hindenburg line by september the germans had fallen back to the hindenburg line the allies had advanced to the hindenburg line in the north and centre german forces launched numerous counterattacks but positions and outposts of the line continued falling with the bef alone taking  prisoners in the last week of september on  september the supreme army command informed the leaders in berlin that armistice talks were inevitable the final assault on the hindenburg line began with the meuseargonne offensive launched by american and french troops on  september two days later the belgians french and british attacked around ypres and the day after the british at st quentin in the centre of the line the following week cooperating american and french units broke through in champagne at the battle of blanc mont ridge   october forcing the germans off the commanding heights and closing towards the belgian frontier on  october the hindenburg line was pierced by british and dominion troops of the first and third british armies at the second battle of cambrai breakthrough of macedonian front september  allied forces started the vardar offensive on  september at two key points dobro pole and near dojran lake in the battle of dobro pole the serbian and french armies had success after a threedaylong battle with relatively small casualties and subsequently made a breakthrough in the front something which was rarely seen in world war i after the front was broken allied forces started to liberate serbia and reached skopje at  september after which bulgaria signed an armistice with the allies on  september armistices and capitulations the collapse of the central powers came swiftly bulgaria was the first to sign an armistice the armistice of salonica on  september  wilhelm ii in a telegram to tsar ferdinand i of bulgaria described the situation thus disgraceful  serbs decided the war on the same day the german supreme army command informed wilhelm ii and the imperial chancellor count georg von hertling that the military situation facing germany was hopeless on  october the italians began a push that rapidly recovered territory lost after the battle of caporetto this culminated in the battle of vittorio veneto marking the end of the austrohungarian army as an effective fighting force the offensive also triggered the disintegration of the austrohungarian empire during the last week of october declarations of independence were made in budapest prague and zagreb on  october the imperial authorities asked italy for an armistice but the italians continued advancing reaching trento udine and trieste on  november austriahungary sent a flag of truce and accepted the armistice of villa giusti arranged with the allied authorities in paris austria and hungary signed separate armistices following the overthrow of the habsburg monarchy in the following days the italian army occupied innsbruck and all tyrol with over  soldiers on  october the ottoman empire capitulated and signed the armistice of mudros german government surrenders with the military faltering and with widespread loss of confidence in the kaiser germany moved towards surrender prince maximilian of baden took charge on  october as chancellor of germany negotiations with president wilson began immediately in the hope that he would offer better terms than the british and french wilson demanded a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary control over the german military the german revolution of  began at the end of october  units of the german navy refused to set sail for a largescale operation in a war they believed to be as good as lost the sailors revolt which then ensued in the naval ports of wilhelmshaven and kiel spread across the whole country within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on  november  shortly thereafter to the abdication of wilhelm ii and german surrender aftermath in the aftermath of the war the german austrohungarian ottoman and russian empires disappeared numerous nations regained their former independence and new ones were created four dynasties fell as a result of the war the romanovs the hohenzollerns the habsburgs and the ottomans belgium and serbia were badly damaged as was france with  million soldiers dead not counting other casualties germany and russia were similarly affected formal end of the war a formal state of war between the two sides persisted for another seven months until the signing of the treaty of versailles with germany on  june  the us senate did not ratify the treaty despite public support for itand did not formally end its involvement in the war until the knoxporter resolution was signed on  july  by president warren g harding for the british empire the state of war ceased under the provisions of the termination of the present war definition act  concerning germany on  january  austria on  july  bulgaria on  august  hungary on  july  turkey on  august  some war memorials date the end of the war as being when the versailles treaty was signed in  which was when many of the troops serving abroad finally returned home by contrast most commemorations of the wars end concentrate on the armistice of  november  peace treaties and national boundaries the paris peace conference imposed a series of peace treaties on the central powers officially ending the war the  treaty of versailles dealt with germany and building on wilsons th point established the league of nations on  june  the central powers had to acknowledge responsibility for all the loss and damage to which the allied and associated governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by their aggression in the treaty of versailles this statement was article  this article became known as the war guilt clause as the majority of germans felt humiliated and resentful the germans felt they had been unjustly dealt with by what they called the diktat of versailles german historian hagen schulze said the treaty placed germany under legal sanctions deprived of military power economically ruined and politically humiliated belgian historian laurence van ypersele emphasises the central role played by memory of the war and the versailles treaty in german politics in the s and s active denial of war guilt in germany and german resentment at both reparations and continued allied occupation of the rhineland made widespread revision of the meaning and memory of the war problematic the legend of the stab in the back and the wish to revise the versailles diktat and the belief in an international threat aimed at the elimination of the german nation persisted at the heart of german politics even a man of peace such as gustav stresemann publicly rejected german guilt as for the nazis they waved the banners of domestic treason and international conspiracy in an attempt to galvanise the german nation into a spirit of revenge like a fascist italy nazi germany sought to redirect the memory of the war to the benefit of its policies meanwhile new nations liberated from german rule viewed the treaty as a recognition of wrongs committed against small nations by much larger aggressive neighboursaustriahungary was partitioned into several successor states largely but not entirely along ethnic lines apart from austria and hungary czechoslovakia italy poland romania and yugoslavia received territories from the dual monarchy the formerly separate and autonomous kingdom of croatiaslavonia was incorporated into yugoslavia the details were contained in the treaties of saintgermainenlaye and trianon as a result hungary lost  of its total population decreasing from  million to  million and losing   out of  million of its ethnic hungarians according to the  census speakers of the hungarian language included approximately  of the entire population of the kingdom of hungary within the country numerous ethnic minorities were present  romanians  slovaks  germans  ruthenians  serbs and  others between  and   hungarians fled former hungarian territories attached to romania czechoslovakia and yugoslavia the russian empire lost much of its western frontier as the newly independent nations of estonia finland latvia lithuania and poland were carved from it romania took control of bessarabia in april  national identities after  years poland reemerged as an independent country the kingdom of serbia and its dynasty as a minor entente nation and the country with the most casualties per capita became the backbone of a new multinational state the kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes later renamed yugoslavia czechoslovakia combining the kingdom of bohemia with parts of the kingdom of hungary became a new nation romania would unite all romanianspeaking people under a single state leading to greater romania in australia and new zealand the battle of gallipoli became known as those nations baptism of fire it was the first major war in which the newly established countries fought and it was one of the first times that australian troops fought as australians not just subjects of the british crown and independent national identities for these nations took hold anzac day named after the australian and new zealand army corps anzac commemorates this defining moment in the aftermath of world war i greece fought against turkish nationalists led by mustafa kemal a war that eventually resulted in a massive population exchange between the two countries under the treaty of lausanne according to various sources several hundred thousand greeks died during this period which was tied in with the greek genocide casualties the total number of military and civilian casualties in world war i was about  million estimates range from around  to  million deaths and about  million wounded military personnel ranking it among the deadliest conflicts in human history the total number of deaths includes between  and  million military personnel with an estimated civilian death toll of about  to  million of the  million european military personnel who were mobilised from  to  an estimated  million were killed  million were permanently disabled and  million were seriously injured germany lost  of its active male population austriahungary lost  and france lost  france mobilised  million men of which  million died and  million were injured approximately  deployed men sustained gruesome facial injuries causing social stigma and marginalisation they were called the gueules cassees broken faces in germany civilian deaths were  higher than in peacetime due in large part to food shortages and malnutrition that had weakened disease resistance these excess deaths are estimated as  in  plus another  in the first half of  when the blockade was still in effect starvation caused by famine killed approximately  people in lebanon diseases flourished in the chaotic wartime conditions in  alone louseborne epidemic typhus killed  in serbia starting in early  a major influenza epidemic known as spanish flu spread across the world accelerated by the movement of large numbers of soldiers often crammed together in camps and transport ships with poor sanitation the spanish flu killed at least  to  million people including an estimated  million europeans and as many as  americans between  and  an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica affected nearly  million people worldwide eight million equines mostly horses donkeys and mules died threequarters of them from the extreme conditions they worked in war crimes chemical weapons in warfare the german army was the first to successfully deploy chemical weapons during the second battle of ypres aprilmay  after german scientists under the direction of fritz haber at the kaiser wilhelm institute developed a method to weaponise chlorine the use of chemical weapons had been sanctioned by the german high command to force allied soldiers out of their entrenched positions complementing rather than supplanting more lethal conventional weapons chemical weapons were deployed by all major belligerents throughout the war inflicting approximately  million casualties of which about  were fatal the use of chemical weapons in warfare was a direct violation of the  hague declaration concerning asphyxiating gases and the  hague convention on land warfare which prohibited their use genocides by the ottoman empire the ethnic cleansing of the ottoman empires armenian population including mass deportations and executions during the final years of the ottoman empire is considered genocide the ottomans carried out organised and systematic massacres of the armenian population at the beginning of the war and manipulated acts of armenian resistance by portraying them as rebellions to justify further extermination in early  several armenians volunteered to join the russian forces and the ottoman government used this as a pretext to issue the tehcir law law on deportation which authorised the deportation of armenians from the empires eastern provinces to syria between  and  the armenians were intentionally marched to death and a number were attacked by ottoman brigands while the exact number of deaths is unknown the international association of genocide scholars estimates around  million the government of turkey continues to deny the genocide to the present day arguing that those who died were victims of interethnic fighting famine or disease during world war i these claims are rejected by most historians other ethnic groups were similarly attacked by the ottoman empire during this period including assyrians and greeks and some scholars consider those events to be part of the same policy of extermination at least  assyrian christians about half of the population and  anatolian and pontic greeks were killed between  and  prisoners of war about  million soldiers surrendered and were held in pow camps during the war all nations pledged to follow the hague conventions on fair treatment of prisoners of war and the survival rate for pows was generally much higher than that of combatants at the front around  of russian losses as a proportion of those captured wounded or killed were to prisoner status for austriahungary  for italy  for france  for germany  for britain  prisoners from the allied armies totalled about  million not including russia which lost  million soldiers as prisoners from the central powers about  million soldiers became prisoners most of them surrendered to russians soldiers experiences allied personnel was around  while central personnel was near  british soldiers of the war were initially volunteers but were increasingly conscripted surviving veterans returning home often found they could discuss their experiences only among themselves so formed veterans associations or legions conscription conscription was common in most european countries but was controversial in englishspeaking countries it was especially unpopular among minority ethnicities especially the irish catholics in ireland australia and the french catholics in canada in the us conscription began in  while the country avoided the outright draft riots that occurred during the civil war and was able to splinter opposition through heavy pressure and sometimes outright repression resistance was nonetheless considerable particularly in rural areas and in the south the administration decided to rely primarily on conscription rather than voluntary enlistment to raise military manpower after only  volunteers enlisted out of the initial  million target in the first six weeks of war military attaches and war correspondents military and civilian observers from every major power closely followed the course of the war many were able to report on events from a perspective somewhat akin to modern embedded positions within the opposing land and naval forces economic effects macro and microeconomic consequences devolved from the war families were altered by the departure of many men with the death or absence of the primary wage earner women were forced into the workforce in unprecedented numbers at the same time the industry needed to replace the lost labourers sent to war the movement of women into industry and traditionally male labor ultimately aided the struggle for voting rights for women in all nations the governments share of gdp increased surpassing  in both germany and france and nearly reaching that level in britain to pay for purchases in the us britain cashed in its extensive investments in american railroads and then began borrowing heavily from wall street president wilson was on the verge of cutting off the loans in late  but allowed a great increase in us government lending to the allies after  the us demanded repayment of these loans the repayments were in part funded by german reparations that in turn were supported by american loans to germany this circular system collapsed in  and some loans were never repaid britain still owed the united states  billion of world war i debt in  the last installment was finally paid in  britain turned to her colonies for help in obtaining essential war materials whose supply from traditional sources had become difficult geologists such as albert kitson were called on to find new resources of precious minerals in the african colonies kitson discovered important new deposits of manganese used in munitions production in the gold coast article  of the treaty of versailles the socalled war guilt clause stated germany accepted responsibility for all the loss and damage to which the allied and associated governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of germany and her allies it was worded as such to lay a legal basis for reparations and a similar clause was inserted in the treaties with austria and hungary however neither of them interpreted it as an admission of war guilt in  the total reparation sum was placed at  billion gold marks however allied experts knew that germany could not pay this sum the total sum was divided into three categories with the third being deliberately designed to be chimerical and its primary function was to mislead public opinion  into believing the total sum was being maintained thus  billion gold marks  billion dollars represented the actual allied assessment of german capacity to pay and therefore  represented the total german reparations figure that had to be paid this figure could be paid in cash or inkind coal timber chemical dyes etc some of the territory lostvia the treaty of versailleswas credited towards the reparation figure as were other acts such as helping to restore the library of louvain by  the great depression caused political chaos throughout the world in  the payment of reparations was suspended by the international community by which point germany had paid only the equivalent of  billion gold marks with the rise of adolf hitler all bonds and loans that had been issued and taken out during the s and early s were cancelled david andelman notes refusing to pay doesnt make an agreement null and void the bonds the agreement still exist thus following the second world war at the london conference in  germany agreed to resume payment on the money borrowed on  october  germany made the final payment on these bonds the australian prime minister billy hughes wrote to the british prime minister david lloyd george you have assured us that you cannot get better terms i much regret it and hope even now that some way may be found of securing agreement for demanding reparation commensurate with the tremendous sacrifices made by the british empire and her allies australia received  in war reparations but the direct cost of the war to australia had been  and by the mids repatriation pensions war gratuities interest and sinking fund charges were  support and opposition for the war support in the balkans yugoslav nationalists such as the leader ante trumbic strongly supported the war desiring the freedom of yugoslavs from austriahungary and other foreign powers and the creation of an independent yugoslavia the yugoslav committee led by trumbic was formed in paris on  april  but shortly moved its office to london in april  the rome congress of oppressed nationalities met including czechoslovak italian polish transylvanian and yugoslav representatives who urged the allies to support national selfdetermination for the peoples residing within austriahungary in the middle east arab nationalism soared in ottoman territories in response to the rise of turkish nationalism during the war arab nationalist leaders advocated the creation of a panarab state in  the arab revolt began in ottomancontrolled territories of the middle east to achieve independence in east africa iyasu v of ethiopia was supporting the dervish state who were at war with the british in the somaliland campaign von syburg the german envoy in addis ababa said now the time has come for ethiopia to regain the coast of the red sea driving the italians home to restore the empire to its ancient size the ethiopian empire was on the verge of entering world war i on the side of the central powers before iyasus overthrow at the battle of segale due to allied pressure on the ethiopian aristocracy several socialist parties initially supported the war when it began in august  but european socialists split on national lines with the concept of class conflict held by radical socialists such as marxists and syndicalists being overborne by their patriotic support for the war once the war began austrian british french german and russian socialists followed the rising nationalist current by supporting their countries intervention in the war italian nationalism was stirred by the outbreak of the war and was initially strongly supported by a variety of political factions one of the most prominent and popular italian nationalist supporters of the war was gabriele dannunzio who promoted italian irredentism and helped sway the italian public to support intervention in the war the italian liberal party under the leadership of paolo boselli promoted intervention in the war on the side of the allies and used the dante alighieri society to promote italian nationalism italian socialists were divided on whether to support the war or oppose it some were militant supporters of the war including benito mussolini and leonida bissolati however the italian socialist party decided to oppose the war after antimilitarist protestors were killed resulting in a general strike called red week the italian socialist party purged itself of prowar nationalist members including mussolini mussolini formed the prointerventionist il popolo ditalia and the fasci rivoluzionario dazione internazionalista revolutionary fasci for international action in october  that later developed into the fasci italiani di combattimento in  the origin of fascism mussolinis nationalism enabled him to raise funds from ansaldo an armaments firm and other companies to create il popolo ditalia to convince socialists and revolutionaries to support the war patriotic funds on both sides there was largescale fundraising for soldiers welfare their dependents and those injured the nail men were a german example around the british empire there were many patriotic funds including the royal patriotic fund corporation canadian patriotic fund queensland patriotic fund and by  there were  funds in new zealand at the start of the next world war the new zealand funds were reformed having been criticised as overlapping wasteful and abused but  were still functioning in  opposition many countries jailed those who spoke out against the conflict these included eugene debs in the us and bertrand russell in britain in the us the espionage act of  and sedition act of  made it a federal crime to oppose military recruitment or make any statements deemed disloyal publications at all critical of the government were removed from circulation by postal censors and many served long prison sentences for statements of fact deemed unpatriotic several nationalists opposed intervention particularly within states that the nationalists were hostile to although the vast majority of irish people consented to participate in the war in  and  a minority of advanced irish nationalists had staunchly opposed taking part the war began amid the home rule crisis in ireland that had resurfaced in  and by july  there was a serious possibility of an outbreak of civil war in ireland irish nationalists and marxists attempted to pursue irish independence culminating in the easter rising of  with germany sending  rifles to ireland to stir unrest in britain the british government placed ireland under martial law in response to the easter rising though once the immediate threat of revolution had dissipated the authorities did try to make concessions to nationalist feeling however opposition to involvement in the war increased in ireland resulting in the conscription crisis of  other opposition came from conscientious objectorssome socialist some religiouswho had refused to fight in britain  people asked for conscientious objector status some of them most notably prominent peace activist stephen hobhouse refused both military and alternative service many suffered years of prison including solitary confinement even after the war in britain many job advertisements were marked no conscientious objectors need to apply on  may  about  workers and soldiers of petrograd and after them the workers and soldiers of other russian cities led by the bolsheviks demonstrated under banners reading down with the war and all power to the soviets the mass demonstrations resulted in a crisis for the russian provisional government in milan in may  bolshevik revolutionaries organised and engaged in rioting calling for an end to the war and managed to close down factories and stop public transportation the italian army was forced to enter milan with tanks and machine guns to face bolsheviks and anarchists who fought violently until  may when the army gained control of the city almost  people including three italian soldiers were killed and over  people were arrested technology world war i began as a clash of thcentury technology and thcentury tactics with the inevitably large ensuing casualties by the end of  however the major armies had modernised and were making use of telephone wireless communication armoured cars tanks especially with the advent of the prototype tank little willie and aircraft several types of poison gas were used by both sides although it never proved a decisive weapon it became one of the most feared of the war artillery also underwent a revolution in  cannons were positioned in the front line and fired directly at their targets by  indirect fire with guns as well as mortars and even machine guns was commonplace using new techniques for spotting and ranging notably aircraft and the field telephone fixedwing aircraft were initially used for reconnaissance and ground attack to shoot down enemy planes antiaircraft guns and fighter aircraft were developed strategic bombers were created principally by the germans and british though the former used zeppelins as well towards the end of the conflict aircraft carriers were used for the first time with hms furious launching sopwith camels in a raid to destroy the zeppelin hangars at tnder in  diplomacy the nonmilitary diplomatic and propaganda interactions among the nations were designed to build support for the cause or to undermine support for the enemy for the most part wartime diplomacy focused on five issues propaganda campaigns defining and redefining the war goals which became harsher as the war went on luring neutral nations italy ottoman empire bulgaria romania into the coalition by offering slices of enemy territory and encouragement by the allies of nationalistic minority movements inside the central powers especially among czechs poles and arabs in addition multiple peace proposals were coming from neutrals or one side or the other none of them progressed very far legacy and memory memorials memorials were built in thousands of villages and towns close to battlefields those buried in improvised burial grounds were gradually moved to formal graveyards under the care of organisations such as the commonwealth war graves commission the american battle monuments commission the german war graves commission and le souvenir francais many of these graveyards also have monuments to the missing or unidentified dead such as the menin gate memorial to the missing and the thiepval memorial to the missing of the somme in  john mccrae a canadian army doctor wrote the poem in flanders fields as a salute to those who perished in the war it is still recited today especially on remembrance day and memorial day national world war i museum and memorial in kansas city missouri is a memorial dedicated to all americans who served in world war i the liberty memorial was dedicated on  november  the british government budgeted substantial resources to the commemoration of the war during the period  to  the lead body is the imperial war museum on  august  french president francois hollande and german president joachim gauck together marked the centenary of germanys declaration of war on france by laying the first stone of a memorial in vieil armand known in german as hartmannswillerkopf for french and german soldiers killed in the war as part of commemorations for the centenary of the  armistice french president emmanuel macron and german chancellor angela merkel visited the site of the signing of the armistice of compiegne and unveiled a plaque to reconciliation historiography the first efforts to comprehend the meaning and consequences of modern warfare began during the initial phases of the war and are still underway more than a century later teaching world war i has presented special challenges when compared with world war ii the first world war is often thought to be a wrong war fought for the wrong reasons it lacks the metanarrative of good versus evil that characterises retellings of the second world war lacking recognisable heroes and villains it is often taught thematically invoking simplified tropes that obscure the complexity of the conflict historian heather jones argues that the historiography has been reinvigorated by a cultural turn in the st century scholars have raised entirely new questions regarding military occupation radicalisation of politics race medical science gender and mental health among the major subjects that historians have long debated regarding the war include why the war began why the allies won whether generals were responsible for high casualty rates how soldiers endured the poor conditions of trench warfare and to what extent the civilian home front accepted and endorsed the war effort unexploded ordnance as late as  unexploded ordnance at battlefield sites like verdun and somme continued to pose a danger in france and belgium locals who discover caches of unexploded munitions are assisted by weapons disposal units in some places plant life has still not recovered from the effects of the war see also freemasonry
