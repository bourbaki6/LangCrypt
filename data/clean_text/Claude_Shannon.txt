claude elwood shannon april    february   was an american polymath who was a mathematician electrical engineer computer scientist cryptographer and inventor known as the father of information theory and the man who laid the foundations of the information age shannon was the first to describe the use of boolean algebraessential to all digital electronic circuitsand helped found the field of artificial intelligence the roboticist rodney brooks declared shannon the th century engineer who contributed the most to st century technologies and the mathematician solomon w golomb described his intellectual achievement as one of the greatest of the twentieth century at the university of michigan shannon dualdegreed graduating with a bachelor of science in electrical engineering and another in mathematics both in  as a yearold masters degree student in electrical engineering at mit his  thesis a symbolic analysis of relay and switching circuits demonstrated that electrical applications of boolean algebra could construct any logical numerical relationship thereby establishing the theory behind digital computing and digital circuits called by some the most important masters thesis of all time it is the birth certificate of the digital revolution and started him in a lifetime of work that led him to win a kyoto prize in  he graduated from mit in  with a phd in mathematics his thesis focusing on genetics contained important results while initially going unpublished shannon contributed to the field of cryptanalysis for national defense of the united states during world war ii including his fundamental work on codebreaking and secure telecommunications writing a paper which is considered one of the foundational pieces of modern cryptography with his work described as a turning point and marked the closure of classical cryptography and the beginning of modern cryptography his work was foundational for symmetrickey cryptography including the work of horst feistel the data encryption standard des and the advanced encryption standard aes as a result shannon has been called the founding father of modern cryptography his  paper a mathematical theory of communication laid the foundations for the field of information theory referred to as a blueprint for the digital era by electrical engineer robert g gallager and the magna carta of the information age by scientific american golomb compared shannons influence on the digital age to that which the inventor of the alphabet has had on literature shannon is also regarded as the most important post contributor to the theory advancements across multiple scientific disciplines utilized shannons theoryincluding the invention of the compact disc the development of the internet the commercialization of mobile telephony and the understanding of black holes he formally introduced the term bit and was a coinventor of both pulsecode modulation and the first wearable computer he also invented the signalflow graph shannon joined the central intelligence agencys special cryptologic advisory group in  from  to  he was a professor at mit he also made numerous contributions to the field of artificial intelligence including coorganizing the  dartmouth workshop considered to be the disciplines founding event and papers on the programming of chess computers his theseus machine was the first electrical device to learn by trial and error being one of the first examples of artificial intelligence biography childhood the shannon family lived in gaylord michigan and claude was born in a hospital in nearby petoskey his father claude sr  was a businessman and for a while a judge of probate in gaylord his mother mabel wolf shannon  was a language teacher who also served as the principal of gaylord high school claude sr was a descendant of new jersey settlers while mabel was a child of german immigrants shannons family was active in their methodist church during his youth most of the first  years of shannons life were spent in gaylord where he attended public school graduating from gaylord high school in  shannon showed an inclination towards mechanical and electrical things his best subjects were science and mathematics at home he constructed such devices as models of planes a radiocontrolled model boat and a barbedwire telegraph system to a friends house a halfmile away while growing up he also worked as a messenger for the western union company shannons childhood hero was thomas edison whom he later learned was a distant cousin both shannon and edison were descendants of john ogden  a colonial leader and an ancestor of many distinguished people logic circuits in  shannon entered the university of michigan where he was introduced to the work of george boole he graduated in  with two bachelors degrees one in electrical engineering and the other in mathematics in  shannon began his graduate studies in electrical engineering at the massachusetts institute of technology mit where he worked on vannevar bushs differential analyzer which was an early analog computer that was composed of electromechanical parts and could solve differential equations while studying the complicated ad hoc circuits of this analyzer shannon designed switching circuits based on booles concepts in  he wrote his masters degree thesis a symbolic analysis of relay and switching circuits with a paper from this thesis published in  a revolutionary work for switching circuit theory in it shannon diagramed switching circuits that could implement the essential operators of boolean algebra then he proved that his switching circuits could be used to simplify the arrangement of the electromechanical relays that were used during that time in telephone call routing switches next he expanded this concept proving that these circuits could solve all problems that boolean algebra could solve in the last chapter he presented diagrams of several circuits including a digital bit full adder his work differed significantly from the work of previous engineers such as akira nakashima who still relied on the existent circuit theory of the time and took a grounded approach shannons ideas were more abstract and relied on mathematics thereby breaking new ground with his work with his approach dominating modernday electrical engineering using electrical switches to implement logic is the fundamental concept that underlies all electronic digital computers shannons work became the foundation of digital circuit design as it became widely known in the electrical engineering community during and after world war ii the theoretical rigor of shannons work superseded the ad hoc methods that had prevailed previously in  howard gardner hailed shannons thesis possibly the most important and also the most famous masters thesis of the century herman goldstine described it in  as surely  one of the most important masters theses ever written  it helped to change digital circuit design from an art to a science one of the reviewers of his work commented that to the best of my knowledge this is the first application of the methods of symbolic logic to so practical an engineering problem from the point of view of originality i rate the paper as outstanding shannons masters thesis won the  alfred noble prize shannon received his phd in mathematics from mit in  vannevar bush had suggested that shannon should work on his dissertation at the cold spring harbor laboratory in order to develop a mathematical formulation for mendelian genetics this research resulted in shannons phd thesis called an algebra for theoretical genetics however the thesis went unpublished after shannon lost interest but it did contain important results notably he was one of the first to apply an algebraic framework to study theoretical population genetics in addition shannon devised a general expression for the distribution of several linked traits in a population after multiple generations under a random mating system which was original at the time with the new theorem unworked out by other population geneticists of the time in  shannon became a national research fellow at the institute for advanced study in princeton new jersey in princeton shannon had the opportunity to discuss his ideas with influential scientists and mathematicians such as hermann weyl and john von neumann and he also had occasional encounters with albert einstein and kurt godel shannon worked freely across disciplines and this ability may have contributed to his later development of mathematical information theory wartime research shannon had worked at bell labs for a few months in the summer of  and returned there to work on firecontrol systems and cryptography during world war ii under a contract with section d control systems section of the national defense research committee ndrc shannon is credited with the invention of signalflow graphs in  he discovered the topological gain formula while investigating the functional operation of an analog computer for two months early in  shannon came into contact with the leading british mathematician alan turing turing had been posted to washington to share with the us navys cryptanalytic service the methods used by the government code and cypher school at bletchley park to break the cyphers used by the kriegsmarine uboats in the north atlantic ocean he was also interested in the encipherment of speech and to this end spent time at bell labs shannon and turing met at teatime in the cafeteria turing showed shannon his  paper that defined what is now known as the universal turing machine this impressed shannon as many of its ideas complemented his own shannon and his team developed antiaircraft systems that tracked enemy missiles and planes while also determining the paths for intercepting missiles in  as the war was coming to an end the ndrc was issuing a summary of technical reports as a last step prior to its eventual closing down inside the volume on fire control a special essay titled data smoothing and prediction in firecontrol systems coauthored by shannon ralph beebe blackman and hendrik wade bode formally treated the problem of smoothing the data in firecontrol by analogy with the problem of separating a signal from interfering noise in communications systems in other words it modeled the problem in terms of data and signal processing and thus heralded the coming of the information age shannons work on cryptography was even more closely related to his later publications on communication theory at the close of the war he prepared a classified memorandum for bell telephone labs entitled a mathematical theory of cryptography dated september  a declassified version of this paper was published in  as communication theory of secrecy systems in the bell system technical journal this paper incorporated many of the concepts and mathematical formulations that also appeared in his a mathematical theory of communication shannon said that his wartime insights into communication theory and cryptography developed simultaneously and that they were so close together you couldnt separate them in a footnote near the beginning of the classified report shannon announced his intention to develop these results  in a forthcoming memorandum on the transmission of information while he was at bell labs shannon proved that the cryptographic onetime pad is unbreakable in his classified research that was later published in  the same article also proved that any unbreakable system must have essentially the same characteristics as the onetime pad the key must be truly random as large as the plaintext never reused in whole or part and kept secret information theory in  the promised memorandum appeared as a mathematical theory of communication an article in two parts in the july and october issues of the bell system technical journal this work focuses on the problem of how best to encode the message a sender wants to transmit shannon developed information entropy as a measure of the information content in a message which is a measure of uncertainty reduced by the message in so doing he essentially invented the field of information theory the book the mathematical theory of communication reprints shannons  article and warren weavers popularization of it which is accessible to the nonspecialist weaver pointed out that the word information in communication theory is not related to what you do say but to what you could say that is information is a measure of ones freedom of choice when one selects a message shannons concepts were also popularized subject to his own proofreading in john robinson pierces symbols signals and noise information theorys fundamental contribution to natural language processing and computational linguistics was further established in  in his article prediction and entropy of printed english showing upper and lower bounds of entropy on the statistics of english  giving a statistical foundation to language analysis in addition he proved that treating space as the th letter of the alphabet actually lowers uncertainty in written language providing a clear quantifiable link between cultural practice and probabilistic cognition another notable paper published in  is communication theory of secrecy systems a declassified version of his wartime work on the mathematical theory of cryptography in which he proved that all theoretically unbreakable cyphers must have the same requirements as the onetime pad he is credited with the introduction of sampling theorem which he had derived as early as  and which is concerned with representing a continuoustime signal from a uniform discrete set of samples this theory was essential in enabling telecommunications to move from analog to digital transmissions systems in the s and later he further wrote a paper in  regarding coding for a noisy channel which also became a classic paper in the field of information theory however also in  he wrote a onepage editorial for the ire transactions on information theory entitled the bandwagon which he began by observing information theory has in the last few years become something of a scientific bandwagon and which he concluded by warning only by maintaining a thoroughly scientific attitude can we achieve real progress in communication theory and consolidate our present position claude shannons influence has been immense in the field for example in a  collection of the key papers in the field of information theory he was author or coauthor of  of the  papers cited while no one else appeared more than three times even beyond his original paper in  he is still regarded as the most important post contributor to the theory in may  mervin kelly received a request from the director of the cia general walter bedell smith regarding shannon and the need for him as shannon was regarded as based on the best authority the most eminently qualified scientist in the particular field concerned as a result of the request shannon became part of the cias special cryptologic advisory group or scag in his time at bell labs he also codeveloped pulsecode modulation alongside bernard m oliver and john r pierce artificial intelligence theseus the mouse in  shannon designed and built with the help of his wife betty a learning machine named theseus it consisted of a maze on a surface through which a mechanical mouse could move below the surface were sensors an electromechanical relay circuit that followed the path of a mechanical mouse through the maze the mouse was designed to search through the corridors until it found the target having travelled through the maze the mouse could then be placed anywhere it had been before and because of its prior experience it could go directly to the target if placed in unfamiliar territory it was programmed to search until it reached a known location and then it would proceed to the target adding the new knowledge to its memory and learning new behavior after much trial and error this device would learn the shortest path through the maze and direct the mechanical mouse through the maze the pattern of the maze could be changed at will by rearranging movable partitions shannons mouse appears to have been the first artificial learning device of its kind mazin gilbert stated that theseus inspired the whole field of ai this random trial and error is the foundation of artificial intelligence other artificial intelligence work shannon wrote multiple influential papers on artificial intelligence such as his  paper titled programming a computer for playing chess and his  paper titled computers and automata alongside john mccarthy he coedited a book titled automata studies which was published in  the categories in the articles within the volume were influenced by shannons own subject headings in his  paper shannon shared mccarthys goal of creating a science of intelligent machines but also held a broader view of viable approaches in automata studies such as neural nets turing machines cybernetic mechanisms and symbolic processing by computer shannon coorganized and participated in the dartmouth workshop of  alongside john mccarthy marvin minsky and nathaniel rochester and which is considered the founding event of the field of artificial intelligence teaching at mit in  shannon joined the mit faculty holding an endowed chair he worked in the research laboratory of electronics rle he continued to serve on the mit faculty until  later life shannon developed alzheimers disease and spent the last few years of his life in a nursing home he died in  survived by his wife a son and daughter and two granddaughters hobbies and inventions outside of shannons academic pursuits he was interested in juggling unicycling and chess he also invented many devices including a roman numeral computer called throbac and juggling machines he built a device that could solve the rubiks cube puzzle shannon also invented flamethrowing trumpets rocketpowered frisbees and plastic foam shoes for navigating a lake by wearing which it would appear to an observer as if shannon were walking on water shannon designed the minivac  a digital computer trainer to teach business people about how computers functioned it was sold by the scientific development corp starting in  he is further considered the coinventor of the first wearable computer along with edward o thorp the device was used to improve the odds when playing roulette personal life shannon married norma levor a wealthy jewish leftwing intellectual in january  the marriage ended in divorce a year later levor later married ben barzman shannon met his second wife mary elizabeth moore betty when she was a numerical analyst at bell labs they were married in  betty assisted claude in building some of his most famous inventions they had three children shannon presented himself as apolitical and an atheist tributes and legacy there are six statues of shannon sculpted by eugene daub one at the university of michigan one at mit in the laboratory for information and decision systems one in gaylord michigan one at the university of california san diego one at bell labs and another at att shannon labs the statue in gaylord is located in the claude shannon memorial park after the breakup of the bell system the part of bell labs that remained with att corporation was named shannon labs in his honor in june  shannon was listed as one of the top  most important scientists in america by fortune in  information theory was listed as one of the top  revolutionary scientific theories by science news according to neil sloane an att fellow who coedited shannons large collection of papers in  the perspective introduced by shannons communication theory now called information theory is the foundation of the digital revolution and every device containing a microprocessor or microcontroller is a conceptual descendant of shannons publication in  hes one of the great men of the century without him none of the things we know today would exist the whole digital revolution started with him the cryptocurrency unit shannon a synonym for gwei is named after him shannon is credited by many as singlehandedly creating information theory and for laying the foundations for the digital age his achievements are considered to be on par with those of albert einstein sir isaac newton and charles darwin the artificial intelligence large language model family claude language model was named in shannons honor a mind at play a biography of shannon written by jimmy soni and rob goodman was published in  they described shannon as the most important genius youve never heard of a man whose intellect was on par with albert einstein and isaac newton consultant and writer tom rutledge writing for boston review stated that of the computer pioneers who drove the midthcentury information technology revolutionan elite mens club of scholarengineers who also helped crack nazi codes and pinpoint missile trajectoriesshannon may have been the most brilliant of them all electrical engineer robert gallager stated about shannon that he had this amazing clarity of vision einstein had it too  this ability to take on a complicated problem and find the right way to look at it so that things become very simple in an obituary by neil sloane and robert calderbank they stated that shannon must rank near the top of the list of major figures of twentieth century science due to his work in multiple fields shannon is also regarded as a polymath historian james gleick noted the importance of shannon stating that einstein looms large and rightly so but were not living in the relativity age were living in the information age its shannon whose fingerprints are on every electronic device we own every computer screen we gaze into every means of digital communication hes one of these people who so transform the world that after the transformation the old world is forgotten gleick further noted that he created a whole field from scratch from the brow of zeus on april   shannon was honored with a google doodle to celebrate his life on what would have been his th birthday the bit player a feature film about shannon directed by mark levinson premiered at the world science festival in  drawn from interviews conducted with shannon in his house in the s the film was released on amazon prime in august  the mathematical theory of communication weavers contribution shannons the mathematical theory of communication begins with an interpretation of his own work by warren weaver although shannons entire work is about communication itself warren weaver communicated his ideas in such a way that those not acclimated to complex theory and mathematics could comprehend the fundamental laws he put forth the coupling of their unique communicational abilities and ideas generated the shannonweaver model although the mathematical and theoretical underpinnings emanate entirely from shannons work after weavers introduction for the layman weavers introduction better communicates the mathematical theory of communication but shannons subsequent logic mathematics and expressive precision was responsible for defining the problem itself other work shannons estimate for the complexity of chess in  shannon completed a paper published in march  which estimates the gametree complexity of chess which is approximately  this number is now often referred to as the shannon number and is still regarded today as an accurate estimate of the games complexity the number is often cited as one of the barriers to solving the game of chess using an exhaustive analysis ie brute force analysis shannons computer chess program on march   shannon presented a paper called programming a computer for playing chess the paper was presented at the national institute for radio engineers convention in new york he described how to program a computer to play chess based on position scoring and move selection he proposed basic strategies for restricting the number of possibilities to be considered in a game of chess in march  it was published in philosophical magazine and is considered one of the first articles published on the topic of programming a computer for playing chess and using a computer to solve the game in  shannon wrote an article titled a chessplaying machine which was published in scientific american both papers have had immense influence and laid the foundations for future chess programs his process for having the computer decide on which move to make was a minimax procedure based on an evaluation function of a given chess position shannon gave a rough example of an evaluation function in which the value of the black position was subtracted from that of the white position material was counted according to the usual chess piece relative value  point for a pawn  points for a knight or bishop  points for a rook and  points for a queen he considered some positional factors subtracting  point for each doubled pawn backward pawn and isolated pawn mobility was incorporated by adding  point for each legal move available shannons maxim shannon formulated a version of kerckhoffs principle as the enemy knows the system in this form it is known as shannons maxim miscellaneous shannon also contributed to combinatorics and detection theory his  paper introduced many tools used in combinatorics he did work on detection theory in  with his work being one of the earliest expositions of the matched filter principle he was known as a successful investor who gave lectures on investing a report from barrons on august   detailed the recent performance of  mutual funds and shannon achieved a higher return than  of them comparing the portfolio of shannon from the late s to  to warren buffetts of  to  shannon had a return of about  percent compared to  for buffett one such method of shannons was labeled shannons demon which was to form a portfolio of equal parts cash and a stock and rebalance regularly to take advantage of the stocks randomly jittering price movements shannon reportedly long thought of publishing about investing but ultimately did not despite giving multiple lectures he was one of the first investors to download stock prices and a snapshot of his portfolio in  was found to be  translating to  million in  excluding another one of his stocks commemorations shannon centenary the shannon centenary  marked the life and influence of claude elwood shannon on the hundredth anniversary of his birth on april   it was inspired in part by the alan turing year an ad hoc committee of the ieee information theory society including christina fragouli rudiger urbanke michelle effros lav varshney and sergio verdu coordinated worldwide events the initiative was announced in the history panel at the  ieee information theory workshop jerusalem and the ieee information theory society newsletter a detailed listing of confirmed events was available on the website of the ieee information theory society some of the activities included bell labs hosted the first shannon conference on the future of the information age on april   in murray hill new jersey to celebrate claude shannon and the continued impact of his legacy on society the event includes keynote speeches by global luminaries and visionaries of the information age who will explore the impact of information theory on society and our digital future informal recollections and leading technical presentations on subsequent related work in other areas such as bioinformatics economic systems and social networks there is also a student competition bell labs launched a web exhibit on april   chronicling shannons hiring at bell labs under an ndrc contract with us government his subsequent work there from  through  and details of mathematics department the exhibit also displayed bios of colleagues and managers during his tenure as well as original versions of some of the technical memoranda which subsequently became well known in published form the republic of macedonia issued a commemorative stamp a usps commemorative stamp is being proposed with an active petition a documentary on claude shannon and on the impact of information theory the bit player was produced by sergio verdu and mark levinson a transatlantic celebration of both george booles bicentenary and claude shannons centenary that is being led by university college cork and the massachusetts institute of technology a first event was a workshop in cork when boole meets shannon and will continue with exhibits at the boston museum of science and at the mit museum many organizations around the world are holding observance events including the boston museum of
