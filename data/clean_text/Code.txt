in communications and information processing code is a system of rules to convert informationsuch as a letter word sound image or gestureinto another form sometimes shortened or secret for communication through a communication channel or storage in a storage medium an early example is an invention of language which enabled a person through speech to communicate what they thought saw heard or felt to others but speech limits the range of communication to the distance a voice can carry and limits the audience to those present when the speech is uttered the invention of writing which converted spoken language into visual symbols extended the range of communication across space and time the process of encoding converts information from a source into symbols for communication or storage decoding is the reverse process converting code symbols back into a form that the recipient understands such as english spanish etc one reason for coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary plain language spoken or written is difficult or impossible for example semaphore where the configuration of flags held by a signaler or the arms of a semaphore tower encodes parts of the message typically individual letters and numbers another person standing a great distance away can interpret the flags and reproduce the words sent theory in information theory and computer science a code is usually considered as an algorithm that uniquely represents symbols from some source alphabet by encoded strings which may be in some other target alphabet an extension of the code for representing sequences of symbols over the source alphabet is obtained by concatenating the encoded strings before giving a mathematically precise definition this is a brief example the mapping c   a    b    c    displaystyle camapsto bmapsto cmapsto  is a code whose source alphabet is the set  a  b  c  displaystyle abc and whose target alphabet is the set      displaystyle   using the extension of the code the encoded string  can be grouped into codewords as     and these in turn can be decoded to the sequence of source symbols acab using terms from formal language theory the precise mathematical definition of this concept is as follows let s and t be two finite sets called the source and target alphabets respectively a code c  s  t  displaystyle csto t is a total function mapping each symbol from s to a sequence of symbols over t the extension c  displaystyle c of c displaystyle c  is a homomorphism of s  displaystyle s into t  displaystyle t  which naturally maps each sequence of source symbols to a sequence of target symbols variablelength codes in this section we consider codes that encode each source clear text character by a code word from some dictionary and concatenation of such code words give us an encoded string variablelength codes are especially useful when clear text characters have different probabilities see also entropy encoding a prefix code is a code with the prefix property there is no valid code word in the system that is a prefix start of any other valid code word in the set huffman coding is the most known algorithm for deriving prefix codes prefix codes are widely referred to as huffman codes even when the code was not produced by a huffman algorithm other examples of prefix codes are telephone country codes the country and publisher parts of isbns and the secondary synchronization codes used in the umts wcdma g wireless standard krafts inequality characterizes the sets of codeword lengths that are possible in a prefix code virtually any uniquely decodable onetomany code not necessarily a prefix one must satisfy krafts inequality errorcorrecting codes codes may also be used to represent data in a way more resistant to errors in transmission or storage this socalled errorcorrecting code works by including carefully crafted redundancy with the stored or transmitted data examples include hamming codes reedsolomon reedmuller walshhadamard bosechaudhurihochquenghem turbo golay algebraic geometry codes lowdensity paritycheck codes and spacetime codes error detecting codes can be optimised to detect burst errors or random errors examples codes in communication used for brevity a cable code replaces words eg ship or invoice with shorter words allowing the same information to be sent with fewer characters more quickly and less expensively codes can be used for brevity when telegraph messages were the state of the art in rapid longdistance communication elaborate systems of commercial codes that encoded complete phrases into single mouths commonly fiveminute groups were developed so that telegraphers became conversant with such words as byoxo are you trying to weasel out of our deal liouy why do you not answer my question bmuld youre a skunk or ayylu not clearly coded repeat more clearly code words were chosen for various reasons length pronounceability etc meanings were chosen to fit perceived needs commercial negotiations military terms for military codes diplomatic terms for diplomatic codes any and all of the preceding for espionage codes codebooks and codebook publishers proliferated including one run as a front for the american black chamber run by herbert yardley between the first and second world wars the purpose of most of these codes was to save on cable costs the use of data coding for data compression predates the computer era an early example is the telegraph morse code where morefrequently used characters have shorter representations techniques such as huffman coding are now used by computerbased algorithms to compress large data files into a more compact form for storage or transmission character encoding a character encoding describes how characterbased data text is encoded antiquated encoding systems used a fixed number of bits ranging from  to  but modern systems use one or more bit bytes for each character ascii the dominate system for decades uses one byte for each character and therefore can encode up to  different characters to support natural languages with more characters other systems were invented that use more than one byte or a variable number of bytes for each character a writing system with a large character set such as chinese japanese and korean can be represented with a multibyte encoding early multibyte encodings were fixedlength meaning that each character is represented by the same number of bytes making them suitable for decoding via a lookup table on the other hand a variablewidth encoding is more complex to decode since it cannot be decoded via a single lookup table and must be processed sequentially but it supports a more efficient representation of a large character set by using a smaller representation for more commonly used characters today utf an encoding of the unicode character set is the most common text encoding used on the internet genetic code biological organisms contain genetic material that is used to control their function and development this is dna which contains units named genes from which messenger rna is derived this in turn produces proteins through a genetic code in which a series of triplets codons of four possible nucleotides can be translated into one of twenty possible amino acids a sequence of codons results in a corresponding sequence of amino acids that form a protein molecule a type of codon called a stop codon signals the end of the sequence godel code in mathematics a godel code is the basis for the proof of godels incompleteness theorem here the idea is to map mathematical notation to a natural number using a godel numbering other there are codes using colors like traffic lights the color code employed to mark the nominal value of the electrical resistors or that of the trashcans devoted to specific types of garbage paper glass organic etc in marketing coupon codes can be used for a financial discount or rebate when purchasing a product from a usual internet retailer in military environments specific sounds with the cornet are used for different uses to mark some moments of the day to command the infantry on the battlefield etc communication systems for sensory impairments such as sign language for deaf people and braille for blind people are based on movement or tactile codes musical scores are the most common way to encode music specific games have their own code systems to record the matches eg chess notation cryptography in the history of cryptography codes were once common for ensuring the confidentiality of communications although ciphers are now used instead secret codes intended to obscure the real messages ranging from serious mainly espionage in military diplomacy business etc to trivial romance games can be any kind of imaginative encoding flowers game cards clothes fans hats melodies birds etc in which the sole requirement is the preagreement on the meaning by both the sender and the receiver other examples other examples of encoding include encoding in cognition  a basic perceptual process of interpreting incoming stimuli technically speaking it is a complex multistage process of converting relatively objective sensory input eg light sound into a subjectively meaningful experience text encoding uses a markup language to tag the structure and other features of a text to facilitate processing by computers see also text encoding initiative semantics encoding of formal language a informal language b is a method of representing all terms eg programs or descriptions of language a using language b data compression transforms a signal into a code optimized for transmission or storage generally done with a codec neural encoding  the way in which information is represented in neurons memory encoding  the process of converting sensations into memories television encoding ntsc pal and secam other examples of decoding include decoding computer science decoding methods methods in communication theory for decoding codewords sent over a noisy channel digital signal processing the study of signals in a digital representation and the processing methods of these signals digitaltoanalog converter the use of analog circuit for decoding operations word decoding the use of phonics to decipher print patterns and translate them into the sounds of language codes in practical use in everyday usage of the term code refers to an element of a code system for example the postal code of my home is a geocode that identifies a geographical entity in a local system eg zip code system of us typical codes are alphanumeric identifiers acronyms and abbreviations can be also considered codes and in a sense all languages and writing systems are codes for human thought international air transport association airport codes are threeletter codes used to designate airports and used for bag tags station codes are similarly used on railways but are usually national so the same code can be used for different stations if they are in different countries occasionally a code word achieves an independent existence and meaning while the original equivalent phrase is forgotten or at least no longer has the precise meaning attributed to the code word for example  was widely used in journalism to mean end of story and has been used in other contexts to signify the end see also addml asemic writing cipher code semiotics cultural code equipment codes quantum error correction semiotics universal language references chevance fabienne  case for the
