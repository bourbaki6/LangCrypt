autobiography gandhi states that they left an indelible impression on his mind gandhi writes it haunted me and i must have acted harishchandra to myself times without number gandhis early

accelerating his studies gandhis wedding was a joint event where his brother and cousin were also married recalling the day of their marriage gandhi once said as we didnt know much about marriage for us it meant only wearing new clothes eating sweets and playing with relatives as was the prevailing tradition the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents house and away from her husband writing many years later gandhi described with regret the lustful feelings he felt for his young bride even at school i used to think of her and the thought of nightfall and our subsequent meeting was ever haunting me gandhi later recalled feeling jealous and possessive of her such as when kasturba would visit a temple with her girlfriends and being sexually lustful in his feelings for her in late

ahmedabad in january  he enrolled at samaldas college in bhavnagar state then the sole degreegranting institution of higher education in the region however gandhi dropped out and returned to his family in porbandar outside school gandhis education was enriched by exposure to gujarati literature especially reformers like narmad and govardhanram tripathi whose works alerted the gujaratis to their own faults and weaknesses such as belief in religious dogmatism three years in london student of law gandhi had dropped out of the cheapest college he could afford in bombay mavji dave joshiji a brahmin priest and family friend advised gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in london in july  gandhis wife kasturba gave birth to their first surviving child harilal gandhis

support him putlibai gave gandhi her permission and blessing on  august  gandhi aged  left porbandar for mumbai then known as bombay a local newspaper covering the farewell function by his old high school in rajkot noted that gandhi was the first bania from kathiawar to proceed to england for his barrister examination as mohandas gandhi waited for a berth on a ship to london he found that he had attracted the ire of the modh banias of bombay upon arrival in bombay he stayed with the local modh bania community whose elders warned gandhi that england would tempt him to compromise his religion and eat and drink in western ways despite gandhi informing them of his promise to his mother and her blessings gandhi was excommunicated from his caste gandhi ignored this and on  september he sailed from bombay to london with his brother seeing him off gandhi attended university college london where he took classes in english literature with henry morley in  gandhi also enrolled at the inns of court school of law in inner temple with the intention of becoming a barrister his childhood shyness and selfwithdrawal had continued through his teens gandhi retained these traits when he arrived in london but joined a public speaking practice group and overcame his shyness sufficiently to practise law gandhi demonstrated a keen interest in the welfare of londons impoverished dockland communities in  a bitter trade dispute broke out in london with dockers striking for better pay and conditions and seamen shipbuilders factory girls and other joining the strike in solidarity the strikers were successful in part due to the mediation of cardinal manning leading gandhi and an indian friend to make a point of visiting the cardinal and thanking him for his work vegetarianism and committee work his vow to his mother influenced gandhis time in london gandhi tried to adopt english customs including taking dancing lessons however he didnt appreciate the bland vegetarian food offered by his landlady and was frequently hungry until he found one of londons few vegetarian restaurants influenced by henry salts writing gandhi joined the london vegetarian society lvs and was elected to its executive committee under the aegis of its president and benefactor arnold hills an achievement while on the committee was the establishment of a bayswater chapter some of the vegetarians gandhi met were members of the theosophical society which had been founded in  to further universal brotherhood and which was devoted to the study of buddhist and hindu literature they encouraged gandhi to join them in reading the bhagavad gita both in translation as well as in the original thomas allinson another lvs member had been promoting newly available birth control methods but hills disapproved of these believing they undermined public morality he believed vegetarianism to be a moral movement and that allinson should therefore no longer remain a member of the lvs gandhi shared hills views on the dangers of birth control but defended allinsons right to differ it would have been hard for gandhi to challenge hills hills was  years his senior and unlike gandhi highly eloquent hills bankrolled the lvs and was a captain of industry with his thames ironworks company employing more than  people in the east end of london hills was also a highly accomplished sportsman who later founded the football club west ham united in his  an autobiography vol i gandhi wrote the question deeply interested me  i had a high regard for mr hills and his generosity but i thought it was quite improper to exclude a man from a vegetarian society simply because he refused to regard puritan morals as one of the objects of the society a motion to remove allinson was raised and was debated and voted on by the committee gandhis shyness was an obstacle to his defence of allinson at the committee meeting gandhi wrote his views down on paper but shyness prevented gandhi from reading out his arguments so hills the president asked another committee member to read them out for him although some other members of the committee agreed with gandhi the vote was lost and allinson was excluded there were no hard feelings with hills proposing the toast at the lvs farewell dinner in honour of gandhis return to india called to the bar gandhi at age  was called to the bar in june  and then left london for india where he learned that his mother had died while he was in london and that his family had kept the news from gandhi his attempts at establishing a law practice in bombay failed because gandhi was psychologically unable to crossexamine witnesses he returned to rajkot to make a modest living drafting petitions for litigants but gandhi was forced to stop after running afoul of british officer sam sunny in  a muslim merchant in kathiawar named dada abdullah contacted gandhi abdullah owned a large successful shipping business in south africa his distant cousin in johannesburg needed a lawyer and they preferred someone with kathiawari heritage gandhi inquired about his pay for the work they offered a total salary of   in  money plus travel expenses he accepted it knowing that it would be at least a oneyear commitment in the colony of natal south africa also a part of the british empire civil rights activist in south africa  in april  gandhi aged  set sail for south africa to be the lawyer for abdullahs cousin gandhi spent  years in south africa where he developed his political views ethics and politics during this time gandhi briefly returned to india in  to mobilise support for the welfare of indians in south africa immediately upon arriving in south africa gandhi faced discrimination due to his skin colour and heritage gandhi was not allowed to sit with european passengers in the stagecoach and was told to sit on the floor near the driver then beaten when he refused elsewhere gandhi was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house in another instance thrown off a train at pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the firstclass gandhi sat in the train station shivering all night and pondering if he should return to india or protest for his rights gandhi chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day in another incident the magistrate of a durban court ordered gandhi to remove his turban which he refused to do indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in south africa gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning when gandhi arrived in south africa according to arthur herman he thought of himself as a briton first and an indian second however the prejudice against gandhi and his fellow indians from british people that gandhi experienced and observed deeply bothered him gandhi found it humiliating struggling to understand how some people can feel honour superiority or pleasure in such inhumane practices gandhi began to question his peoples standing in the british empire the abdullah case that had brought him to south africa concluded in may  and the indian community organised a farewell party for gandhi as he prepared to return to india the farewell party was turned into a working committee to plan the resistance to a new natal government discriminatory proposal this led to gandhi extending his original period of stay in south africa gandhi planned to assist indians in opposing a bill to deny them the right to vote a right then proposed to be an exclusive european right he asked joseph chamberlain the british colonial secretary to reconsider his position on this bill though unable to halt the bills passage gandhis campaign was successful in drawing attention to the grievances of indians in south africa he helped found the natal indian congress in  and through this organisation gandhi moulded the indian community of south africa into a unified political force in january  when gandhi landed in durban a mob of white settlers attacked him gandhi refused to press charges against any member of the mob during the boer war gandhi volunteered in  to form a group of stretcherbearers as the natal indian ambulance corps according to arthur herman gandhi wanted to disprove the british colonial stereotype that hindus were not fit for manly activities involving danger and exertion unlike the muslim martial races gandhi raised  indian volunteers to support british combat troops against the boers they were trained and medically certified to serve on the front lines they were auxiliaries at the battle of colenso to a white volunteer ambulance corps at the battle of spion kop gandhi and his bearers moved to the front line and had to carry wounded soldiers for miles to a field hospital since the terrain was too rough for the ambulances gandhi and  other indians received the queens south africa medal in  the transvaal government promulgated a new act compelling registration of the colonys indian and chinese populations the law required asians to undergo fingerprint registration and to carry identity certificates that officials could demand at any time historians have noted that gandhis resistance was therefore also a protest against a system of biometric identification that treated indians as criminal subjects gandhi initially accepted voluntary registration as a gesture of trust but later realized that once fingerprints were recorded individuals lost the right to withdraw their consent this then shaped gandhis understanding of satyagraha as a defense of dignity and personal autonomy at a mass protest meeting held in johannesburg on  september that year gandhi adopted his still evolving methodology of satyagraha devotion to the truth or nonviolent protest for the first time according to anthony parel gandhi was also influenced by the tamil moral text tirukkural after leo tolstoy mentioned it in their correspondence that began with a letter to a hindu gandhi urged indians to defy the new law and to suffer the punishments for doing so his ideas of protests persuasion skills and public relations had emerged gandhi took these back to india in  europeans indians and africans gandhi focused his attention on indians and africans while he was in south africa initially gandhi was not interested in politics but this changed after he was discriminated against and bullied such as by being thrown out of a train coach due to his skin colour by a white train official after several such incidents with whites in south africa gandhis thinking and focus changed and he felt he must resist this and fight for rights gandhi entered politics by forming the natal indian congress according to ashwin desai and goolam vahed gandhis views on racism are contentious in some cases he suffered persecution from the beginning in south africa like with other coloured people white officials denied gandhi his rights and the press and those in the streets bullied and called gandhi a parasite semibarbarous canker squalid coolie yellow man and other epithets people would even spit on him as an expression of racial hate while in south africa gandhi focused on the racial persecution of indians before he started to focus on racism against africans in some cases state desai and vahed gandhis behaviour was one of being a willing part of racial stereotyping and african exploitation during a speech in september  gandhi complained that the whites in the british colony of south africa were degrading the indian to the level of a raw kaffir scholars cite it as an example of evidence that gandhi at that time thought of indians and black south africans differently as another example given by herman gandhi at the age of  prepared a legal brief for the natal assembly in  seeking voting rights for indians gandhi cited race history and european orientalists opinions that anglosaxons and indians are sprung from the same aryan stock or rather the indoeuropean peoples and argued that indians should not be grouped with the africans years later gandhi and his colleagues served and helped africans as nurses and by opposing racism the nobel peace prize winner nelson mandela is among admirers of gandhis efforts to fight against racism in africa the general image of gandhi state desai and vahed has been reinvented since his assassination as though gandhi was always a saint when in reality his life was more complex contained inconvenient truths and was one that changed over time scholars have also pointed the evidence to a rich history of cooperation and efforts by gandhi and indian people with nonwhite south africans against persecution of africans and the apartheid in  gandhi started the indian opinion a journal that carried news of indians in south africa indians in india with articles on all subjects  social moral and intellectual each issue was multilingual and carried material in english gujarati hindi and tamil it carried ads depended heavily on gandhis contributions often printed without a byline and was an advocate for the indian cause in  when the bambatha rebellion broke out in the colony of natal the then yearold gandhi despite sympathising with the zulu rebels encouraged indian south africans to form a volunteer stretcherbearer unit writing in the indian opinion gandhi argued that military service would be beneficial to the indian community and claimed it would give them health and happiness gandhi eventually led a volunteer mixed unit of indian and african stretcherbearers to treat wounded combatants during the suppression of the rebellion the medical unit commanded by gandhi operated for less than two months before being disbanded by  gandhis newspaper indian opinion was covering reports on discrimination against africans by the colonial regime gandhi remarked that the africans alone are the original inhabitants of the land  the whites on the other hand have occupied the land forcibly and appropriated it for themselves in  gandhi established with the help of his friend hermann kallenbach an idealistic community they named tolstoy farm near johannesburg there gandhi nurtured his policy of peaceful resistance in the years after black south africans gained the right to vote in south africa  gandhi was proclaimed a national hero with numerous monuments struggle for indian independence  at the request of gopal krishna gokhale gandhi returned to india in  gandhi joined the indian national congress and was introduced to indian issues politics and the indian people primarily by gokhale gokhale was a key leader of the congress party best known for his restraint and moderation and his insistence on working inside the system gandhi took gokhales liberal approach based on british whiggish traditions and transformed it to make it look indian gandhi took leadership of the congress in  and began escalating demands until on  january  the indian national congress declared the independence of india the british did not recognise the declaration but negotiations ensued with the congress taking a role in provincial government in the late s gandhi and the congress withdrew their support of the raj when the viceroy declared war on germany in september  without consultation tensions escalated until gandhi demanded immediate independence in  and the british responded by imprisoning him and tens of thousands of congress leaders meanwhile the muslim league did cooperate with britain and moved against gandhis strong opposition to demands for a totally separate muslim state of pakistan in august  the british partitioned the land with india and pakistan each achieving independence on terms that gandhi disapproved role in world war i in april  during the latter part of world war i the viceroy invited gandhi to a war conference in delhi gandhi agreed to support the war effort in contrast to the zulu war of  and the outbreak of world war i in  when he recruited volunteers for the ambulance corps this time gandhi attempted to recruit combatants in a june  leaflet entitled appeal for enlistment gandhi wrote to bring about such a state of things we should have the ability to defend ourselves that is the ability to bear arms and to use them if we want to learn the use of arms with the greatest possible despatch it is our duty to enlist ourselves in the army however gandhi stipulated in a letter to the viceroys private secretary that he personally will not kill or injure anybody friend or foe gandhis support for the war campaign brought into question his consistency on nonviolence gandhis private secretary noted that the question of the consistency between his creed of ahimsa nonviolence and his recruiting campaign was raised not only then but has been discussed ever since according to political and educational scientist christian bartolf gandhis support for the war stemmed from his belief that true ahimsa could not exist simultaneously with cowardice therefore gandhi felt that indians needed to be willing and capable of using arms before they voluntarily chose nonviolence in july  gandhi said that he could not persuade even one individual to enlist for the world war so far i have not a single recruit to my credit apart gandhi wrote he added they object because they fear to die champaran agitations gandhis first major achievement came in  with the champaran agitation in bihar the champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against largely angloindian plantation owners who were backed by the local administration the peasants were forced to grow indigo indigofera sp a cash crop for indigo dye whose demand had been declining over two decades and were forced to sell their crops to the planters at a fixed price unhappy with this the peasantry appealed to gandhi at his ashram in ahmedabad pursuing a strategy of nonviolent protest gandhi took the administration by surprise and won concessions from the authorities kheda agitations in  kheda was hit by floods and famine and the peasantry was demanding relief from taxes gandhi moved his headquarters to nadiad organising scores of supporters and fresh volunteers from the region the most notable being vallabhbhai patel using noncooperation as a technique gandhi initiated a signature campaign where peasants pledged nonpayment of revenue even under the threat of confiscation of land a social boycott of mamlatdars and talatdars revenue officials within the district accompanied the agitation gandhi worked hard to win public support for the agitation across the country for five months the administration refused but by the end of may  the government gave way on important provisions and relaxed the conditions of payment of revenue tax until the famine ended in kheda vallabhbhai patel represented the farmers in negotiations with the british who suspended revenue collection and released all the prisoners khilafat movement in  gandhi sought muslim cooperation by supporting the defeated ottoman empire this was in part motivated by the british promise to reciprocate the help with swaraj selfgovernment to indians after the war instead the british government offered only minor reforms disappointing gandhi he announced his satyagraha civil disobedience intentions the british countered with the rowlatt act to block gandhis movement making civil disobedience a criminal offence and enabling internment without trial gandhi leveraged the khilafat movement wherein sunni muslims in india championed the turkish caliph as a symbol of sunni islam ummah gandhis support gave mixed results it initially brought strong muslim support however hindu leaders including rabindranath tagore questioned gandhis leadership because they opposed recognising the caliph gandhis increased muslim support temporarily stopped hindumuslim communal violence and helped sideline muhammad ali jinnah jinna went on to lead the demand for a muslim homeland though they agreed on indian independence they disagreed on the means of achieving it jinnah favoured constitutional negotiation rather than agitating the masses in  the khilafat movement collapsed following the end of the noncooperation movement and gandhis arrest a number of muslim leaders abandoned gandhi and congress hindumuslim communal conflicts reignited and deadly religious riots reappeared in numerous cities noncooperation with his book hind swaraj  gandhi aged  declared that british rule was established in india with the cooperation of indians and had survived only because of this if indians refused to cooperate british rule would collapse and swaraj indian independence would come in february  gandhi cautioned the viceroy of india that the rowlatt act would result in civil disobedience the british government ignored him and the satyagraha civil disobedience followed with british law officers firing on unarmed people riots followed gandhi urged peaceful protest the jallianwala bagh massacre enraged the subcontinent gandhi criticised his fellow countrymen for not exclusively using love to deal with the hate of the british government gandhi shifted his attention to swaraj and political independence for india in  gandhi became the leader of the indian national congress gandhi expanded his nonviolence to include the swadeshi policy  the boycott of foreignmade goods especially british goods and to boycott british institutions and law courts gandhi was arrested on  march  tried for sedition and sentenced to six years imprisonment salt satyagraha salt marchcivil disobedience movement after his release from prison in  gandhi continued to pursue swaraj he pushed through a resolution at the calcutta congress in december  calling on the british government to grant india dominion status or face further noncooperation the british did not respond favourably gandhi led congress in a celebration on  january  of indias independence day in lahore gandhi launched a new satyagraha against the british salt tax in march  condemning british rule in a letter to the viceroy this was highlighted by the salt march from  march to  april where gandhi and volunteers marched  kilometres  mi from ahmedabad to dandi gujarat to make salt himself with the declared intention of breaking the salt laws watched by huge crowds on  may gandhi was interned under a regulation dating from  in anticipation of a planned protest the protest at dharasana salt works on  may went ahead without gandhi and was brutally suppressed the campaign succeeded in upsetting the british britain responded by imprisoning at least  people gandhi as folk hero indian congress in the s appealed to andhra pradesh peasants by creating telugu language plays that combined indian mythology and legends linked them to gandhis ideas and portrayed gandhi as a messiah a reincarnation of ancient and medieval indian nationalist leaders and saints the plays built support among peasants steeped in traditional hindu culture according to murali and this effort made gandhi a folk hero in telugu speaking villages a sacred messiahlike figure according to dennis dalton it was gandhis ideas that were responsible for his wide following gandhi criticised western civilisation as one driven by brute force and immorality contrasting it with his categorisation of indian civilisation as one driven by soul force and morality gandhi captured the imagination of the people of his heritage with his ideas about winning hate with love these ideas are evidenced in his pamphlets from the s in south africa where too gandhi was popular among the indian indentured workers after he returned to india people flocked to gandhi because he reflected their values gandhi also campaigned hard going from one rural corner of the indian subcontinent to another he used terminology and phrases such as ramarajya from ramayana prahlada as a paradigmatic icon and such cultural symbols as another facet of swaraj and satyagraha during gandhis lifetime these ideas sounded strange outside india but they readily and deeply resonated with the culture and historic values of his people negotiations the government represented by lord irwin the viceroy of india decided to negotiate with gandhi the gandhiirwin pact was signed in march  the british government agreed to free all political prisoners in return for the suspension of the civil disobedience movement according to the pact gandhi was invited to attend the round table conference in london for discussions and as the sole representative of the indian national congress the conference was a disappointment to gandhi and the nationalists gandhi expected to discuss indias independence while the british side focused on the indian princes and indian minorities rather than on a transfer of power lord irwins successor lord willingdon took a hard line against india as an independent nation began a new campaign of controlling and subduing the nationalist movement gandhi was again arrested and the government tried and failed to negate his influence by completely isolating him from his followers in britain winston churchill a prominent conservative politician who was then out of office but later became its prime minister became a vigorous and articulate critic of gandhi and opponent of his longterm plans churchill often ridiculed gandhi saying in a widely reported  speech it is alarming and also nauseating to see mr gandhi a seditious middle temple lawyer now posing as a fakir of a type well known in the east striding halfnaked up the steps of the viceregal palaceto parley on equal terms with the representative of the kingemperor churchills bitterness against gandhi grew in the s he called gandhi as the one who was seditious in aim whose evil genius and multiform menace was attacking the british empire churchill called him a dictator a hindu mussolini fomenting a race war trying to replace the raj with brahmin cronies playing on the ignorance of indian masses all for selfish gain churchill attempted to isolate gandhi and his criticism of gandhi was widely covered by european and american press it gained churchill sympathetic support but it also increased support for gandhi among europeans the developments heightened churchills anxiety that the british themselves would give up out of pacifism and misplaced conscience round table conferences during the discussions between gandhi and the british government over  at the round table conferences gandhi now aged about  sought constitutional reforms as a preparation to the end of colonial british rule and begin the selfrule by indians the british side sought reforms that would keep the indian subcontinent as a colony the british negotiators proposed constitutional reforms on a british dominion model that established separate electorates based on religious and social divisions the british questioned the congress party and gandhis authority to speak for all of india they invited indian religious leaders such as muslims and sikhs to press their demands along religious lines as well as b r ambedkar as the representative leader of the untouchables gandhi vehemently opposed a constitution that enshrined rights or representations based on communal divisions because he feared that it would not bring people together but divide them perpetuate their status and divert the attention from indias struggle to end the colonial rule the second round table conference was the only time gandhi left india between  and his death in  he was accompanied by his secretary mahadev desai son devdas gandhi and british supporter mirabehn gandhi declined the governments offer of accommodation in an expensive west end hotel preferring to stay in the east end to live among workingclass people as he did in india gandhi based himself in a small cellbedroom at his friend muriel lesters peoples house at kingsley hall for the threemonth duration of his stay he was enthusiastically received by east enders local children gave him toys for his birthday and lester noted that he would gently place them on window sills and in carriages during his stay and took them back to india after gandhi returned from the second round table conference he started a new satyagraha gandhi was arrested and imprisoned at the yerwada jail pune while he was in prison the british government enacted a new law that granted untouchables a separate electorate it came to be known as the communal award in protest gandhi started a fastuntodeath while he was held in prison the resulting public outcry forced the government in consultations with ambedkar to replace the communal award with a compromise poona pact congress politics in  gandhi resigned from congress party membership he did not disagree with the partys position but felt that if he resigned gandhis popularity with indians would cease to stifle the partys membership which actually varied including communists socialists trade unionists students religious conservatives and those with probusiness convictions and that these various voices would get a chance to make themselves heard gandhi also wanted to avoid being a target for raj propaganda by leading a party that had temporarily accepted political accommodation with the raj in  gandhi returned to active politics again with the nehru presidency and the lucknow session of the congress although gandhi wanted a total focus on the task of winning independence and not speculation about indias future he did not restrain the congress from adopting socialism as its goal gandhi had a clash with subhas chandra bose who had been elected president in  and who had previously expressed a lack of faith in nonviolence as a means of protest despite gandhis opposition bose won a second term as congress president against gandhis nominee bhogaraju pattabhi sitaramayya gandhi declared that sitaramayyas defeat was his defeat bose later left the congress when the allindia leaders resigned en masse in protest of his abandonment of the principles introduced by gandhi world war ii and quit india movement gandhi opposed helping the british war effort and campaigned against participation in world war ii the british government arrested gandhi and killed over  members of the movement violent attacks were carried out by nationalists against the british the movement played a role in weakening british control and paved the way for indian independence gandhi was motivated by his belief that india could not be party to a war for democratic freedom while that freedom was denied to india he explicitly called for the british to quit india in a  speech in mumbai the british government responded quickly arresting gandhi indians retaliated by damaging hundreds of government owned railway stations and police stations and cutting telegraph wires in  gandhi urged his people to completely stop cooperating with the imperial government again calling for nonviolence he urged indians to karo ya maro do or die in the cause of their rights and freedoms his arrest lasted two years he was released before the end of the war on  may  because of his failing health and necessary surgery the raj did not want him to die in prison and enrage the nation gandhi and jinnah had extensive correspondence and the two men met several times in september  jinnah rejected gandhis proposal for hindumuslim coexistence insisting on partitioning the subcontinent on religious lines to create a muslim homeland later pakistan at the end of the war the british

cremated is the raj ghat memorial in new delhi a black marble platform it bears the epigraph he rama devanagari    or hey raam these are said to be gandhis last words after he was shot principles practices and beliefs gandhis spirituality was greatly based on his embracement of the five great vows of jainism and hindu yoga philosophy viz satya truth ahimsa nonviolence brahmacharya celibacy asteya nonstealing and aparigraha nonattachment he stated that unless you impose on yourselves the five vows you may not embark on the experiment at all gandhis statements letters and life have attracted much political and scholarly analysis of his principles practices and beliefs including what influenced him some writers present gandhi as a paragon of ethical living and pacifism while others present him as a more complex contradictory and evolving character influenced by his culture and circumstances truth and satyagraha gandhi dedicated his life to discovering and pursuing truth or satya and called his movement satyagraha which means appeal to insistence on or reliance on the truth the first formulation of the satyagraha as a political movement and principle occurred in  which gandhi tabled as resolution on noncooperation in september that year before a session of the indian congress it was the satyagraha formulation and step states dennis dalton that deeply resonated with beliefs and culture of his people embedded him into the popular consciousness transforming him quickly into mahatma gandhi based satyagraha on the vedantic ideal of selfrealisation ahimsa nonviolence vegetarianism and universal love william borman states that the key to his satyagraha is rooted in the hindu upanishadic texts according to indira carr gandhis ideas on ahimsa and satyagraha were founded on the philosophical foundations of advaita vedanta i bruce watson states that some of these ideas are found not only in traditions within hinduism but also in jainism or buddhism particularly those about nonviolence vegetarianism and universal love but gandhis synthesis was to politicise these ideas his concept of satya as a civil movement states glyn richards are best understood in the context of the hindu terminology of dharma and rta gandhi stated that the most important battle to fight was overcoming his own demons fears and insecurities gandhi summarised his beliefs first when he said god is truth gandhi would later change this statement to truth is god thus satya truth in gandhis philosophy is god gandhi states richards described the term god not as a separate power but as the being brahman atman of the advaita vedanta tradition a nondual universal that pervades in all things in each person and all life according to nicholas gier this to gandhi meant the unity of god and humans that all beings have the same one soul and therefore equality that atman exists and is same as everything in the universe ahimsa nonviolence is the very nature of this atman the essence of satyagraha is soul force as a political means refusing to use brute force against the oppressor seeking to eliminate antagonisms between the oppressor and the oppressed aiming to transform or purify the oppressor it is not inaction but determined passive resistance and noncooperation where states arthur herman love conquers hate a euphemism sometimes used for satyagraha is that it is a silent force or a soul force a term also used by martin luther king jr during his i have a dream speech it arms the individual with moral power rather than physical power satyagraha is also termed a universal force as it essentially makes no distinction between kinsmen and strangers young and old man and woman friend and foe gandhi wrote there must be no impatience no barbarity no insolence no undue pressure if we want to cultivate a true spirit of democracy we cannot afford to be intolerant intolerance betrays want of faith in ones cause civil disobedience and noncooperation as practised under satyagraha are based on the law of suffering a doctrine that the endurance of suffering is a means to an end this end usually implies a moral upliftment or progress of an individual or society therefore noncooperation in satyagraha is in fact a means to secure the cooperation of the opponent consistently with truth and justice while gandhis idea of satyagraha as a political means attracted a widespread following among indians the support was not universal for example muslim leaders such as jinnah opposed the satyagraha idea accused gandhi to be reviving hinduism through political activism and began effort to counter gandhi with muslim nationalism and a demand for muslim homeland the untouchability leader ambedkar in june  after his decision to convert to buddhism and the first law and justice minister of modern india dismissed gandhis ideas as loved by blind hindu devotees primitive influenced by spurious brew of tolstoy and ruskin and there is always some simpleton to preach them winston churchill caricatured gandhi as a cunning huckster seeking selfish gain an aspiring dictator and an atavistic spokesman of a pagan hinduism churchill stated that the civil disobedience movement spectacle of gandhi only increased the danger to which white people there british india are exposed nonviolence although gandhi was not the originator of the principle of nonviolence he was the first to apply it in the political field on a large scale the concept of nonviolence ahimsa has a long history in indian religious thought and is considered the highest dharma ethical valuevirtue a precept to be observed towards all living beings sarvbhuta at all times sarvada in all respects sarvatha in action words and thought gandhi explains his philosophy and ideas about ahimsa as a political means in his autobiography the story of my experiments with truth although gandhi considered nonviolence to be infinitely superior to violence he preferred violence to cowardice gandhi added that he would rather have india resort to arms in order to defend her honor than that she should in a cowardly manner become or remain a helpless witness to her own dishonor brahmacharya abstinence from sex and food along with many other texts gandhi studied the bhagavad gita while in south africa this hindu scripture discusses jnana yoga bhakti yoga and karma yoga along with virtues such as nonviolence patience integrity lack of hypocrisy self restraint and abstinence gandhi began experiments with these and in  at age  although married he vowed to abstain from sexual relations gandhis experiment with abstinence went beyond sex and extended to food he consulted the jain scholar shrimad rajchandra whom he fondly called raychandbhai rajchandra advised him that milk stimulated sexual passion gandhi began abstaining from cows milk in  and did so even when doctors advised him to consume milk according to sankar ghose tagore described gandhi as someone who did not abhor sex or women but considered sexual life as inconsistent with his moral goals gandhi tried to test and prove to himself his brahmacharya the experiments began some time after the death of his wife in february  at the start of his experiment he had women sleep in the same room but in different beds he later slept with women in the same bed often naked in april  gandhi referenced sleeping with several women or girls in a letter to birla as part of the experiments according to the s memoir of his grandniece manu gandhi feared in early  that he and she may be killed by muslims in the runup to indias independence in august  and asked her when she was  years old if she wanted to help him with his experiments to test their purity for which she readily accepted gandhi also shared his bed with yearold abha wife of his grandnephew kanu gandhi would sleep with both manu and abha at the same time to test his celibacy according to sean scalmer gandhi in his final year of life was an ascetic and his sickly skeletal figure was caricatured in western media in february  he asked his confidants such as birla and ramakrishna if it was wrong for him to test his brahmacharya oath gandhis public experiments as they progressed were widely discussed and criticised by his family members and leading politicians however gandhi said that if he would not let manu sleep with him it would be a sign of weakness some of his staff resigned including two of his newspapers editors who had refused to print some of gandhis sermons dealing with his experiments nirmalkumar bose gandhis bengali interpreter for example criticised gandhi not because gandhi did anything wrong but because bose was concerned about the psychological effect on the women who participated in his experiments veena howard states gandhis views on brahmacharya and religious renunciation experiments were a method to confront women issues in his times gandhi also supported alcohol abstinence advocating prohibition as the only effective way to deal with alcohol usage literary works gandhi was a prolific writer his signature style was simple precise clear and devoid of artificialities one of gandhis earliest publications hind swaraj published in gujarati in  became the intellectual blueprint for indias independence movement the book was translated into english the

reprinted his other autobiographies included satyagraha in south africa about his struggle there hind swaraj or indian home rule a political pamphlet and a paraphrase in gujarati of john ruskins unto this last which was an early critique of political economy this last essay can be considered his programme on economics gandhi also wrote extensively on vegetarianism diet and health religion social reforms etc gandhi usually wrote in gujarati though he also revised the hindi and english translations of his books in  gandhi wrote songs from prison while prisoned in yerawada jail in maharashtra
