australia officially the commonwealth of australia is a country comprising the mainland of the australian continent the island of tasmania and numerous smaller islands it has a total area of  km  sq mi making it the sixthlargest country in the world and the largest in oceania australia is the worlds flattest and driest inhabited continent it is a megadiverse country and its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes and climates including deserts in the interior and tropical rainforests along the coast the ancestors of aboriginal australians began arriving from southeast asia  to  years ago during the last glacial period by the time of british settlement aboriginal australians spoke more than  distinct languages and had one of the oldest living cultures in the world australias written history commenced with dutch exploration of most of the coastline in the th century british colonisation began in  with the establishment of the penal colony of new south wales by the midth century most of the continent had been explored by european settlers and five additional selfgoverning british colonies were established each gaining responsible government by  the colonies federated in  forming the commonwealth of australia this continued a process of increasing autonomy from the united kingdom highlighted by the statute of westminster adoption act  and culminating in the australia acts of  australia is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy and a federation comprising six states and ten territories its population of almost  million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard canberra is the nations capital while its most populous cities are sydney and melbourne each with a population of more than five million australias culture is diverse and the country has one of the highest foreignborn populations in the world it has a highly developed economy and one of the highest per capita incomes globally its abundant natural resources and welldeveloped international trade relations are crucial to the countrys economy it ranks highly for quality of life health education economic freedom civil liberties and political rights australia is a middle power and has the worlds thirteenthhighest military expenditure it is a member of international groups including the united nations the g the oecd the world trade organization asiapacific economic cooperation the pacific islands forum the pacific community and the commonwealth of nations australia also participates in the defence intelligence and security alliances anzus aukus and five eyes it is a major nonnato ally of the united states etymology the name australia pronounced in australian english is derived from the latin terra australis incognita unknown southern land a name used for a hypothetical continent in the southern hemisphere since ancient times several thcentury cartographers used the word australia on maps but not to identify modern australia when the dutch began visiting and mapping australia in the th century they called the continent new holland the name australia was popularised by the explorer matthew flinders who circumnavigated the continent in  however when his account of his voyage was published in  the name terra australis was used governor of new south wales lachlan macquarie officially recommended the name australia to replace new holland in december  the british admiralty adopted the name in  and the british parliament used it in legislation in  the united kingdom hydrographic office used the new name in the australia directory of  the name commonwealth of australia for the new federation of the six former colonies was formalised in the commonwealth of australia constitution act  uk colloquial names for australia include oz straya and down under history indigenous prehistory indigenous australians comprise two broad groups aboriginal australians who are the various indigenous peoples of the australian mainland and many of its islands including tasmania torres strait islanders who are a distinct melanesian people of torres strait islands human habitation of the australian continent is estimated to have begun  to  years ago with the migration of people by land bridges and short sea crossings from what is now southeast asia it is uncertain how many waves of immigration may have contributed to these ancestors of modern aboriginal australians the madjedbebe rock shelter in arnhem land is possibly the oldest site showing the presence of humans in australia the oldest human remains found are the lake mungo remains which have been dated to around  years ago aboriginal australian culture is one of the oldest continuous cultures on earth at the time of first european contact aboriginal australians belonged to wide range of societies with diverse economies spread across at least  different language groups estimates of the aboriginal population before british settlement range from  to  million aboriginal australians cultures were and remain deeply connected with the land and the environment with stories of the dreaming maintained through oral tradition songs dance and paintings certain groups engaged in firestick farming fish farming and built semipermanent shelters these practices have variously been characterised as huntergatherer agricultural natural cultivation and intensification torres strait islander people first settled their islands at least  years ago culturally and linguistically distinct from mainland aboriginal peoples they were seafarers and obtained their livelihood from seasonal horticulture and the resources of their reefs and seas agriculture also developed on some islands and villages appeared by the s by the midth century in northern australia contact trade and crosscultural engagement had been established between local aboriginal groups and makassan trepangers visiting from presentday indonesia european exploration and colonisation the dutch east india company ship duyfken captained by willem janszoon made the first documented european landing in australia in  later that year luis vaz de torres sailed to the north of australia through torres strait along new guineas southern coast abel tasmans voyage of  was the first known european expedition to reach van diemens land on his second voyage of  he mapped the north coast of australia south of new guinea following tasmans voyages the dutch were able to make almost complete maps of australias northern and western coasts and much of its southern and southeastern tasmanian coasts they named the continent new holland in  captain james cook sailed along and mapped the east coast which he named new south wales and claimed for great britain in  the british government announced its intention to establish a penal colony in new south wales on  january  the first fleet commanded by captain arthur phillip arrived at sydney cove port jackson a camp was established and the union flag raised the date later became australias national day most early settlers were convicts transported for petty crimes and assigned as labourers or servants to free settlers willing immigrants once emancipated convicts tended to integrate into colonial society aboriginal resistance convict rebellions and bushranging were sometimes suppressed under martial law the  rum rebellion carried out by officers of the new south wales corp led to a temporary military junta during the next two decades social and economic reforms together with the establishment of a legislative council and supreme court saw the penal colony transition to a civil society the indigenous population declined for  years following european settlement mainly due to infectious disease british colonial authorities did not sign any treaties with aboriginal groups as settlement expanded tens of thousands of indigenous people and thousands of settlers were killed in frontier conflicts which many historians argue included acts of genocide by settlers settlers dispossessed surviving indigenous peoples of most of their land colonial expansion in  a settlement was established in van diemens land presentday tasmania and in  gregory blaxland william lawson and william wentworth crossed the blue mountains west of sydney opening the interior to european settlement the british claim was extended to the whole australian continent in  when major edmund lockyer established a settlement on king george sound modernday albany the swan river colony presentday perth was established in  evolving into the largest australian colony by area western australia separate colonies were carved from new south wales tasmania in  south australia in  victoria in  and queensland in  south australia and victoria were founded as free coloniesthey never accepted transported convicts growing opposition to the convict system culminated in its abolition in the eastern colonies by the s initially a free colony western australia accepted convicts from  to  the six colonies individually gained responsible government between  and  managing most of their own affairs while remaining part of the british empire the colonial office in london retained control of some matters notably foreign affairs the colonial parliaments progressively extended voting rights to adult men from  with womens suffrage on equal terms following between the s and s some colonies introduced racial restrictions on voting from  in the midth century explorers such as burke and wills charted australias interior a series of gold rushes beginning in the early s led to an influx of new migrants from china north america and continental europe as well as outbreaks of bushranging and civil unrest the latter peaked in  when ballarat miners launched the eureka rebellion against gold licence fees the s saw the rise of blackbirding where south sea islanders were coerced or abducted into indentured labour mainly by queensland colonists from  australian colonial governments began removing many aboriginal children from their families and communities justified on the grounds of child protection and forced assimilation policies the second boer war  marked the largest overseas deployment of australias colonial forces federation to the world wars on  january  federation of the colonies was achieved after a decade of planning constitutional conventions and referendums resulting in the establishment of the commonwealth of australia as a nation under the new australian constitution from  australia was a selfgoverning dominion within the british empire it was one of the founding members of the league of nations in  and the united nations in  the statute of westminster  ended the ability of the uk to legislate for australia at the federal level without australias consent australia adopted it in  but it was backdated to  to confirm the validity of legislation passed during world war ii the australian capital territory was formed in  as the location for the future federal capital of canberra while it was being constructed melbourne served as the temporary capital from  to  the northern territory was transferred from the control of south australia to the commonwealth in  australia took over the administration of the territory of papua which had previously been a british colony in  and of the territory of new guinea formerly german new guinea in  the two were unified as the territory of papua and new guinea in  and gained independence from australia in  in  australia joined the allies in the first world war and took part in the fighting on several fronts of the  men who served overseas about  were killed and another  were wounded many australians regard the defeat of the australian and new zealand army corps anzac at gallipoli in  as the baptism of fire that forged the new nations identity the beginning of the campaign is commemorated annually on anzac day a date which rivals australia day as the nations most important from  to  australia joined the allies in fighting the second world war australias armed forces fought in the pacific european and mediterranean and middle east theatres the shock of britains defeat in singapore in  followed soon after by the bombing of darwin and other japanese attacks on australian soil led to a widespread belief in australia that a japanese invasion was imminent and a shift from the united kingdom to the united states as australias principal ally and security partner since  australia has been allied with the united states under the anzus treaty postwar and contemporary eras in the three decades following world war ii australia experienced significant increases in living standards leisure time and suburban development governments encouraged a large wave of immigration from across europe and called these migrants new australians high immigration was justified to australians using the slogan populate or perish and from the s the white australia policy was gradually relaxed a member of the western bloc during the cold war australia participated in the korean war and the malayan emergency during the s and the vietnam war from  to  tensions over communist influence in society led to unsuccessful attempts by the menzies government to ban the communist party of australia and a bitter split in the labor party in  as a result of a  referendum the federal government gained the power to legislate with regard to aboriginal australians and aboriginal australians were fully included in the census precolonial land interests referred to as native title in australia was recognised in law for the first time when the high court of australia held in mabo v queensland no  that australia was not terra nullius land belonging to no one at the time of european settlement following the abolition of the last vestiges of the white australia policy in  australias demography and culture transformed as a result of a large and ongoing wave of noneuropean immigration mostly from asia the late th century also saw an increasing focus on foreign policy ties with other asiapacific nations the australia acts of  severed the remaining constitutional ties between australia and the united kingdom while maintaining the monarch in her independent capacity as queen of australia in a  constitutional referendum  of voters rejected abolishing the monarchy and becoming a republic following the september  attacks on the united states australia joined the united states in fighting the afghanistan war from  to  and the iraq war from  to  the nations trade relations also became increasingly oriented towards east asia in the st century with china becoming the nations largest trading partner by a large margin in response to the covid pandemic from march  lockdowns and other restrictions on public gatherings and movement across the national and state borders were implemented by the federal state and territory governments following the rollout of vaccines in  these restrictions were gradually eased in october  australia declared that covid was no longer a communicable disease incident of national significance geography general characteristics australia consists of the mainland australian continent the island of tasmania numerous smaller offshore islands and the remote offshore territories of ashmore and cartier islands christmas island cocos keeling islands coral sea islands heard and mcdonald islands and norfolk island australia also claims about  of antarctica as the australian antarctic territory but this claim is only recognised by four other countries mainland australia lies between latitudes  and  south and longitudes  and  east surrounded by the indian and pacific oceans australia is separated from asia by the arafura and timor seas with the coral sea lying off the queensland coast and the tasman sea lying between australia and new zealand the great barrier reef the worlds largest coral reef lies a short distance off the northeast coast and extends for more than  km  mi the mainland is the worlds smallest continent and the country is the sixthlargest by total area australia is sometimes considered the worlds largest island and is often dubbed the island continent it has  km  mi of coastline excluding all offshore islands and claims an exclusive economic zone of  square kilometres  sq mi this exclusive economic zone does not include the australian antarctic territory most of australia is arid or semiarid in  australia had  of the global permanent meadows and pastureland forest cover is around  of australias land area the australian mainland is relatively flat with an average height of  metres  ft compared with  metres  ft for all continents the great dividing range runs along most of eastern australia dividing the central lowlands from the eastern highlands at  m  ft mount kosciuszko is the highest mountain on the mainland taller are mawson peak at  m  ft on heard island and in the australian antarctic territory mount mcclintock and mount menzies at  m  ft and  m  ft respectivelythe murraydarling is the major river system draining most of inland new south wales and southern queensland towards lake alexandrina and the sea in south australia there are also smaller coastal river systems inland drainage systems such as the lake eyre system and salt lake systems in central and western australia australias rivers have the lowest discharge into the sea of any continent the mainlands flat arid profile also makes its rivers slowmoving resulting in a build up of salt on the land salinisation adversely affects australias soil which is on average poor in nutrients compared with world standards australias population is concentrated on the coastal fringes about  of the population lives within  km of the coast the world average is  australias population density is  inhabitants per square kilometre which is one of the lowest in the world however there is a large concentration of the population in cities along the temperate southeastern coastline and population density exceeds  inhabitants per square kilometre in central melbourne geology formerly part of the rodinia and gondwana supercontinents australia completely separated from antarctica about  million years ago and continued drifting northwards when the last glacial period ended rising sea levels separated the australian mainland from new guinea about  years ago and from tasmania about  years ago australia lies well within the australian tectonic plate the mainland is relatively stable geologically with no major mountain building active volcanoes or tectonic faults however the australian plate is moving northnortheast at a rate of about  to  cm a year and is currently in collision with the eurasian plate and pacific plate the resulting intratectonic stresses lead to relatively high seismic activity for a geologically stable landmass there were  earthquakes with a moment magnitude of greater than  between  and  the newcastle earthquake of  was australias deadliest killing  people there were active volcanoes on the eastern mainland as recently as  years ago and this is reflected in aboriginal place names and creation stories currently volcanism occurs in the remote heard island and mcdonald islands the australian continental crust was created in three cycles from the oldest archaean cratons in the west to the younger orogenic formations in the east built about  million to  million years ago the oldest australian surface rocks date to the archaean period some in western australia are older than  billion years and others in south australia are over  billion years old the oldest zircon crystals on earth dating back  billion years have been found in western australia however about  per cent of australia is covered by sedimentary rocks and regolith that are less than  million years old climate the australian climate ranges from wet tropical in the northeast and northwest to arid in the centre the coastal south is temperate and humid with winter freezing and snow in the southeastern highlands and tasmania the climate is influenced by australias position in the horse latitudes which tends to bring arid conditions overall the australian mainland is the driest inhabited continent with an average annual rainfall of  millimetres  in about  of the country is arid or semiarid and about  is desert the climate is also influenced by various systems such as the el ninosouthern oscillation the indian ocean dipole and the southern annular mode australia has unusual variability in rainfall within years and between years leading to frequent droughts and flooding cyclones and rain depressions are common in tropical australia the summer monsoon brings significant rainfall to northern australia and low pressure cells bring winter rainfall in the south the hottest regions are in the northwest of the country and the coolest in the southeast bushfire conditions are common in southern australia climate change from increased greenhouse gas emissions has led to a  c rise in australian temperatures since  and an increase in extreme heat and heavy rainfall events there has been a reduction in rainfall from april to october in southern australia since  and a longer bushfire season since the s rainfall has increased in northern australia since the s the number of tropical cyclones has fallen since  and alpine snow has decreased since the late s sea levels are rising around australia and the surrounding oceans are becoming more acidic biodiversity australia is one of  megadiverse countries because of its long geographic isolation much of australias biota is unique about  of its amphibians  of its reptiles and flowering plants  of its mammals and  of its birds are endemic australia has a wide range of ecosystems of which  regions and  subregions are recognised in the australian bioregion framework in january  there were  named species on the australian national species list however it is estimated that  of australian species have not been discovered and classified and that there may be  australian native species in general knowledge of vertebrates and flowering plants is better than for invertebrates and fungi it is estimated that less that  of australias fungi and insects have been named about  of the worlds known plant species are found in australia many of these have adapted to the arid climate variable rainfall and nutrientpoor soil deserts and xeric shrubland cover about  of the mainland acacia banksia and eucalypts have spread over much of australia many plants have hard and longliving leaves and are rich in carbon poor in nutrients and well adapted to bushfires about twothirds of the worlds  species of marsupials are native to australia australian placental mammals overwhelmingly bats rats and mice also make up almost  of the worlds land mammal species australia has about  of the worlds known reptile species there are also about  invertebrate species of which insects are the largest class accounting for more than  of all animal species australia has over  known species of fungi although it is possible that tens of thousands more exist australias wildlife show many adaptations to their environments as the leaves of most plants are poor in nutrients australia has a high proportion of birds insects and marsupials such as the honey possum that feed on nectar and pollen the koala is an exception specialising in feeding on eucalyptus leaves nutritionally poor flora and variable rainfall also favour animals with lower energy requirements including snakes lizards and hopping marsupials such as the kangaroo and wallaby there is however evidence of convergent evolution of australias marsupials and the placental mammals of other continents living in similar environments for example the extinct thylacine tasmanian tiger had similarities with the placental wolf marsupial moles with the golden moles of africa and hopping mice with the hopping rodents of other arid regions there were major extinctions of australias vertebrates including its megafauna around  thousand years ago and there is an ongoing scientific debate over the role of human activity and climate change in these extinctions the contraction of the range of the tasmanian tiger and tasmanian devil to that island around  to  years ago is also consistent with changes on the mainland including an increasing human population the introduction of the dingo and the greater use of fire and new stone tool technologies over the past two centuries australia has lost more mammal species than any other continent overall  australian species are listed as extinct or extinct in the wild in june  over  animal and plant species were listed by australian governments as endangered or critically endangered the major threats to endangered species are landscape change ecosystem disruption introduced species such as the feral cat and red fox and climate change the federal environment protection and biodiversity conservation act  is the legal framework for the protection of threatened species the national reserve system is australias network of protected areas as at  june  it covered over  of australias land mass australias strategy for nature  is the national biodiversity plan that aims to reverse biodiversity loss in australia by  and meet the countys obligations under the united nations convention on biological diversity and other international agreements government and politics australia is a constitutional monarchy a parliamentary democracy and a federation the country has maintained its mostly unchanged constitution alongside a stable liberal democratic political system since federation in  it is one of the worlds oldest federations in which power is divided between the federal and state governments the australian system of government combines elements derived from the political systems of the united kingdom a fused executive constitutional monarchy and strong party discipline and the united states federalism a written constitution and strong bicameralism with a senate in which states have equal representation resulting in a distinct hybrid federal government power is partially separated between three groups legislature the bicameral parliament comprising the monarch the senate and the house of representatives executive the australian government led by the prime minister the leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the house of representatives their chosen cabinet and other ministers formally appointed by the governorgeneral judiciary the high court and other federal courts following elections on  may  the prime minister is anthony albanese of the australian labor party charles iii reigns as king of australia and is represented in australia by the governorgeneral at the federal level and by the governors at the state level who by section  of the constitution and convention act on the advice of their ministers thus in practice the governorgeneral acts as a legal figurehead for the actions of the prime minister and the cabinet the governorgeneral may in some situations exercise reserve powers powers exercisable in the absence of or contrary to ministerial advice when these powers may be exercised is governed by convention and their precise scope is unclear the most notable exercise of these powers was the dismissal of the whitlam government in the constitutional crisis of  in the senate the upper house there are  senators twelve each from the states and two each from the mainland territories the australian capital territory and the northern territory the house of representatives the lower house has  members elected from singlemember electoral divisions commonly known as electorates or seats allocated to states on the basis of population with each of the current states guaranteed a minimum of five seats the lower house has a maximum term of three years but this is not fixed and governments usually dissolve the house early for an election at some point in the  months before the maximum elections for both chambers are generally held simultaneously with senators having overlapping sixyear terms except for those from the territories whose terms are not fixed but are tied to the electoral cycle for the lower house thus only  of the  places in the senate are put to each election unless the cycle is interrupted by a double dissolution australias electoral system uses preferential voting for the house of representatives and all state and territory lower house elections with the exception of tasmania and the act which use the hareclark system the senate and most state upper houses use the proportional system which combines preferential voting with proportional representation for each state voting and enrolment is compulsory for all enrolled citizens  years and older in every jurisdiction the party with majority support in the house of representatives forms the government and its leader becomes prime minister the governorgeneral appoints the prime minister and may dismiss one who has lost the confidence of parliament or acts illegally as australia is a westminster parliamentary democracy with a powerful and elected upper house its system has sometimes been called a washminster mutation or semiparliamentary there are two major political groups that have usually formed government federally the australian labor party and the coalition which is a grouping of the liberal party and its minor partner the national party at the state level of government the relationship between the nationals and the liberal party differs with the parties merged in queensland and the northern territory federal parliamentarians however sit in either the liberal or national party room in coalition in new south wales victoria and western australia and in competition with the liberals in south australia and tasmania within australian political culture the labor party is considered centreleft and the coalition is considered centreright independent members and several minor parties have achieved representation in australian parliaments mostly in upper houses the australian greens have been the third largest party by both vote and membership since  states and territories australia has six statesnew south wales nsw victoria vic queensland qld western australia wa south australia sa and tasmania tasand two mainland selfgoverning territoriesthe australian capital territory act and the northern territory nt the states have the general power to make laws except in the few areas where the constitution grants the commonwealth the federal level of government exclusive powers the commonwealth can only make laws on topics listed in the constitution but its laws prevail over those of the states to the extent of any inconsistency since federation the commonwealths power relative to the states has significantly increased due to the increasingly wide interpretation given to listed commonwealth powers  and because of the states heavy financial reliance on commonwealth grants each state and major mainland territory has its own parliamentunicameral in the northern territory the act and queensland and bicameral in the other states the lower houses are known as the legislative assembly the house of assembly in south australia and tasmania the upper houses are known as the legislative council the head of the government in each state is the premier and in each territory the chief minister the king is represented in each state by a governor at the commonwealth level the kings representative is the governorgeneral the commonwealth government directly administers the internal jervis bay territory and the external territories the ashmore and cartier islands the coral sea islands the heard island and mcdonald islands the indian ocean territories christmas island and the cocos keeling islands norfolk island and the australian antarctic territory the remote macquarie island and lord howe island are part of tasmania and new south wales respectively foreign relations australia is a middle power whose foreign relations has three core bipartisan pillars commitment to the us alliance engagement with the indopacific and support for international institutions rules and cooperation through the anzus pact and its status as a major nonnato ally australia maintains a close relationship with the us which encompasses strong defence security and trade ties in the indopacific the country seeks to increase its trade ties through the open flow of trade and capital while managing the rise of chinese power by supporting the existing rulesbased order regionally the country is a member of the pacific islands forum the pacific

transpacific partnership and the regional comprehensive economic partnership multilateral free trade agreements as well as bilateral free trade agreements with the united states china japan south korea indonesia the united kingdom and new zealand with the most recent deal signed in  with the uk australia maintains a deeply integrated relationship with neighbouring new zealand with free mobility of citizens between the two countries under the transtasman travel arrangement and free trade under the closer economic relations agreement the most favourably viewed countries by the australian people in  include new zealand the united kingdom japan germany taiwan thailand the united states and south korea it also maintains an international aid program under which some  countries receive assistance australia ranked fourth in the center for global developments  commitment to development index the power over foreign policy is highly concentrated in the prime minister and the national security committee with major decision such as joining the  invasion of iraq made without prior cabinet approval similarly the parliament does not play a formal role in foreign policy and the power to declare war lies solely with the executive government the department of foreign affairs and trade supports the executive in its policy decisions military the two main institutions involved in the management of australias armed forces are the australian defence force adf and the department of defence together known as defence the australian defence force is the military wing headed by the chief of the defence force and contains three branches the royal australian navy the australian army and the royal australian air force in  it had  currently serving personnel including  regulars and  reservists the department of defence is the civilian wing and is headed by the secretary of defence these two leaders collective manage defence as a diarchy with shared and joint responsibilities the titular role of commanderinchief is held by the governorgeneral however actual command is vested in the chief of the defence force the executive branch of the commonwealth government has overall control of the military through the minister of defence who is subject to the decisions of cabinet and its national security committee major australian intelligence agencies include the australian

prize in physics chemistry or medicine and two have been awarded the fields medal facilities supporting space exploration include the square kilometre array and australia telescope compact array radio telescopes telescopes such as the siding spring observatory and ground stations such as the canberra deep space communication complex demographics the population of australia is estimated to be  as of  january  it is the th most populous country in the world and the most populous oceanian country australia has a population density of  persons per square kilometre of total land area which makes it one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world the population is heavily concentrated on the east coast and in particular in the southeastern region between south east queensland to the northeast and adelaide to the southwest australia is also highly urbanised with  of the population living in the greater capital city statistical areas metropolitan areas of the state and mainland territorial capital cities in  metropolitan areas with more than one million inhabitants are sydney melbourne brisbane perth and adelaide in common with many other developed countries australia is experiencing a demographic shift towards an older population with more retirees and fewer people of working age in  the average age of the population was  years cities australia has five cities including their suburbs that have populations larger than one million people the majority of australias population lives near coastlines ancestry and immigration between  and the second world war the vast majority of settlers and immigrants came from the british isles principally england ireland and scotland although australia had significant immigration from china and germany during the th century following federation in  the white australia policy was strengthened restricting further migration from these areas however this policy was relaxed following ww and in the decades following australia received a large wave of immigration from across europe with many more immigrants arriving from southern and eastern europe than in previous decades all overt racial discrimination ended in  with multiculturalism becoming official policy subsequently there has been a large and continuing wave of immigration from across the world with asia being the largest source of immigrants in the st century today australia has the worlds eighthlargest immigrant population with immigrants accounting for  of the population the highest proportion among major western nations in   permanent migrants
