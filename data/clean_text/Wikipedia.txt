wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers known as wikipedians through open collaboration and the wiki software mediawiki founded by jimmy wales and larry sanger in  wikipedia has been hosted since  by the wikimedia foundation an american nonprofit organization funded mainly by donations from readers wikipedia is the largest and mostread reference work in history initially available only in english wikipedia exists in over  languages and is one of the worlds most visited websites the english wikipedia with over  million articles remains the largest of the editions which together comprise more than  million articles and attract more than  billion unique device visits and  million edits per month about five edits per second on average as of april  as of december  over  of wikipedias traffic comes from the united states while japan accounts for nearly  and the united kingdom germany and russia each represent around  wikipedia has been praised for enabling the democratization of knowledge its extensive coverage unique structure and culture wikipedia has been censored by some national governments ranging from specific pages to the entire site sometimes due to its criticism of the government or by content otherwise considered blasphemous although wikipedias volunteer editors have written extensively on a wide variety of topics the encyclopedia has also been criticized for systemic bias such as a gender bias against women and a geographical bias against the global south while the reliability of wikipedia was frequently criticized in the s it has improved over time receiving greater praise from the late s onward articles on breaking news are often accessed as sources for uptodate information about those events history nupedia various collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before the start of wikipedia but with limited success wikipedia began as a complementary project for nupedia a free online englishlanguage encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process it was founded on march   under the ownership of bomis a web portal company its main figures were bomis ceo jimmy wales and larry sanger editorinchief for nupedia and later wikipedia nupedia was initially licensed under its own nupedia open content license but before wikipedia was founded nupedia switched to the gnu free documentation license at the urging of richard stallman wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia while sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal on january   sanger proposed on the nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a feeder project for nupedia launch and growth wikipedia was launched on january   referred to as wikipedia day as a single english language edition with the domain name wwwwikipediacom and was announced by sanger on the nupedia mailing list the name proposed by sanger to forestall any potential damage to the nupedia name originated from a blend of the words wiki and encyclopedia its integral policy of neutral point of view arose within its first year otherwise there were initially relatively few rules and it operated independently of nupedia bomis originally intended for it to be a forprofit business wikipedia gained early contributors from nupedia slashdot postings and web search engine indexing language editions were created beginning in march  with a total of  in use by the end of  nupedia and wikipedia coexisted until the formers servers were taken down permanently in  and its text was incorporated into wikipedia the english wikipedia passed the mark of  million articles on september   making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled surpassing the yongle encyclopedia made in china during the ming dynasty in  which had held the record for almost  years due to fears of commercial advertising and lack of control users of the spanish wikipedia forked from wikipedia to create enciclopedia libre in february  wales then announced that wikipedia would not display advertisements and changed wikipedias domain from wikipediacom to wikipediaorg after an early period of exponential growth the growth rate of the english wikipedia in terms of the numbers of new articles and of editors appears to have peaked around early  the edition reached  million articles in august  around  articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in  by  that average was roughly  a team at the palo alto research center attributed this slowing of growth to increased coordination and overhead costs exclusion of newcomers and resistance to new edits others suggested that the growth flattened naturally because articles that could be called lowhanging fruittopics that clearly merit an articlehad already been created and built up extensively in november  a researcher at the rey juan carlos university in madrid spain found that the english wikipedia had lost  editors during the first three months of  in comparison it lost only  editors during the same period in  the wall street journal cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend wales disputed these claims in  denying the decline and questioning the studys methodology two years later in  he acknowledged a slight decline noting a decrease from a little more than  writers in june  to  in june  in the same interview he also claimed the number of editors was stable and sustainable a  mit technology review article the decline of wikipedia questioned this claim reporting that since  wikipedia had lost a third of its volunteer editors and suggesting that those remaining had focused increasingly on minutiae in july  the atlantic reported that the number of administrators was also in decline in november  new york magazine stated wikipedia the sixthmostused website is facing an internal crisis the number of active english wikipedia editors has since remained steady after a long period of decline on january   subodh varma reporting for the economic times indicated that not only had wikipedias growth stalled it had lost nearly ten percent of its page views last year there was a decline of about  billion between december  and december  its most popular versions are leading the slide pageviews of the english wikipedia declined by twelve percent those of german version slid by  percent and the japanese version lost  percent varma added while wikipedias managers think that this could be due to errors in counting other experts feel that googles knowledge graphs project launched last year may be gobbling up wikipedia users when contacted on this matter clay shirky associate professor at new york university and fellow at harvards berkman klein center for internet  society said that he suspected much of the pageview decline was due to knowledge graphs stating if you can get your question answered from the search page you dont need to click any further by the end of december  wikipedia was ranked the fifth most popular website globally as of january   english wikipedia articles have been cited  times in scholarly journals from which cloud computing was the most cited page sister projects wikipedia has spawned several sister projects which are also wikis run by the wikimedia foundation these other wikimedia projects include wiktionary a dictionary project launched in december  wikiquote a collection of quotations created a week after wikimedia launched wikibooks a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts wikimedia commons a site devoted to freeknowledge multimedia wikinews for collaborative journalism and wikiversity a project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities another sister project of wikipedia wikispecies is a catalog of all species but is not open for public editing in  wikivoyage an editable travel guide and wikidata an editable knowledge base launched milestones in january  wikipedia first became one of the ten most popular websites in the united states according to comscore networks with  million unique visitors it was ranked ninth surpassing the new york times no  and apple no  this marked a significant increase over january  when wikipedia ranked rd with around  million unique visitors in  it received  billion page views every month on february   the new york times reported that wikipedia had  billion page views and nearly  million unique visitors a month according to the ratings firm comscore as of march  it ranked sixth in popularity according to similarweb jeff loveland and joseph reagle argue that in process wikipedia follows a long tradition of historical encyclopedias that have accumulated improvements piecemeal through stigmergic accumulation on january   the english wikipedia participated in a series of coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the united states congressthe stop online piracy act sopa and the protect ip act pipaby blacking out its pages for  hours more than  million people viewed the blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced its content in january   wikipedia an asteroid was named after wikipedia in october  wikipedia was honored with the wikipedia monument and in july   of the  page volumes of wikipedia became available as print wikipedia in april  an israeli lunar lander beresheet crash landed on the surface of the moon carrying a copy of nearly all of the english wikipedia engraved on thin nickel plates experts say the plates likely survived the crash in june  scientists reported that all  gb of article text from the english wikipedia had been encoded into synthetic dna on january   wikipedia debuted a new website redesign called vector  it featured a redesigned menu bar moving the table of contents to the left as a sidebar and numerous changes in the locations of buttons like the language selection tool the update initially received backlash most notably when editors of the swahili wikipedia unanimously voted to revert the changes both sanger and wales have given public interviews in late  about their reflections about the status and state of wikipedia leading up to its  years of operation on january   wales appeared on the pbs television news show gzero world interviewed by ian bremmer and sanger has appeared on the fox news network interviewed by ashley rindsberg waless book the seven rules of trust was published in october  by penguin random house it was described by the publisher as a sweeping reflection on the global crisis of credibility and knowledge with the book examining the rules of trust that enabled the growth and success of wikipedia impacts of generative ai on wikipedia views since january  the wikimedia foundation has reported a roughly  percent increase in bandwidth use from downloads of multimedia content across its projects according to the foundation this growth is largely attributed to automated programs or scraper bots that collect large volumes of data from wikimedia sites for use in training large language models and related applications in october  the wikimedia foundation reported an estimated  percent decline in traffic as compared to the same months in  in human page views they speculate it reflects the use of generative ai and social media on how people tend to search for information collaborative editing restrictions due to wikipedias increasing popularity some editions including the english version have introduced editing restrictions for certain cases for instance on the english wikipedia and some other language editions only users with  edits that have an account that is four days old may create a new article on the english wikipedia among others particularly controversial sensitive or vandalismprone pages have been protected to varying degrees a frequently vandalized article can be semiprotected or extended confirmed protected meaning that only autoconfirmed or extended confirmed editors can modify it a particularly contentious article may be locked so that only administrators can make changes a  article in the columbia journalism review identified wikipedias pageprotection policies as perhaps the most important means at its disposal to regulate its market of ideas wikipedia has delegated some functions to bots such algorithmic governance has an ease of implementation and scaling though the automated rejection of edits may have contributed to a downturn in active wikipedia editors bots must be approved by the community before their tasks are implemented in certain cases all editors are allowed to submit modifications but review is required for some editors depending on certain conditions for example the german wikipedia maintains stable versions of articles which have passed certain reviews following protracted trials and community discussion the english wikipedia introduced the pending changes system in december  under this system new and unregistered users edits to certain controversial or vandalismprone articles are reviewed by established users before they are published however restrictions on editing may reduce the editor engagement as well as efforts to diversify the editing community articles related to the israelipalestinian conflict are placed under extendedconfirmed protection editors also can make only one revert per day across the entire field and can be banned from editing related articles these restrictions were introduced in  in january  the arbitration committee introduced the balanced editing restriction which requires sanctioned users to devote only a third of their edits to articles related to the israelipalestinian conflict even when no misconduct rules have been violated review of changes although changes are not systematically reviewed wikipedias software provides tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others each articles history page links to each revision on most articles anyone can view the latest changes and undo others revisions by clicking a link on the articles history page registered users may maintain a watchlist of articles that interest them so they can be notified of changes new pages patrol is a process where newly created articles are checked for obvious problems in  economics phd student andrea ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in a wiki created a catalyst for collaborative development and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favored creative construction over creative destruction vandalism any change that deliberately compromises wikipedias integrity is considered vandalism the most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor it can also include advertising and other types of spam sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page less common types of vandalism such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information can be more difficult to detect vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting modify page semantics such as the pages title or categorization manipulate the articles underlying code or use images disruptively obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from wikipedia articles the median time to detect and fix it is a few minutes however some vandalism takes much longer to detect and repair in the seigenthaler biography incident an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of american political figure john seigenthaler in may  falsely presenting him as a suspect in the assassination of john f kennedy it remained uncorrected for four months seigenthaler the founding editorial director of usa today and founder of the freedom forum first amendment center at vanderbilt university called wikipedia cofounder jimmy wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation wales said he did not although the perpetrator was eventually traced after the incident seigenthaler described wikipedia as a flawed and irresponsible research tool the incident led to policy changes at wikipedia for tightening up the verifiability of biographical articles of living people disputes and edit warring wikipedia editors often have disagreements regarding content which can be discussed on article talk pages disputes may result in repeated competing changes to an article known as edit warring it is widely seen as a resourceconsuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added and criticized as creating a competitive and conflictbased editing culture associated with traditional masculine gender roles research has focused on for example impoliteness of disputes the influence of rival editing camps the conversational structure and the shift in conflicts to a focus on sources taha yasseri of the university of oxford examined editing conflicts and their resolution in a  study yasseri contended that simple reverts or undo operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive work behavior at wikipedia he relied instead on mutually reverting edit pairs where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then in sequence returns to revert the first editor the results were tabulated for several language versions of wikipedia the english wikipedias three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles george w bush anarchism and muhammad by comparison for the german wikipedia the three largest conflict rates at the time of the study were for the articles covering croatia scientology and  conspiracy theories in  researchers identified other measures of editor behaviors beyond mutual reverts to identify editing conflicts across wikipedia editors also debate the deletion of articles on wikipedia with roughly  such debates since wikipedias inception once an article is nominated for deletion the dispute is typically determined by initial votes to keep or delete and by reference to topicspecific notability policies policies and content wikipedia is composed of  different namespaces with its articles being present in mainspace other namespaces have a prefix before their page title and fulfill various purposes for example the project namespace uses the wikipedia prefix and is used for selfgovernance related discussions most readers are not aware of these other namespaces the fundamental principles of the wikipedia community are embodied in the five pillars while the detailed editorial principles are expressed in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content the five pillars are wikipedia is an encyclopedia wikipedia is written from a neutral point of view wikipedia is free content that anyone can use edit and distribute wikipedias editors should treat each other with respect and civility wikipedia has no firm rules the rules developed by the community are stored in wiki form and wikipedia editors write and revise the websites policies and guidelines in accordance with community consensus originally rules on the nonenglish editions of wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the english wikipedia they have since diverged to some extent content policies and guidelines according to the rules on the english wikipedia community each entry in wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or dictionarystyle a topic should also meet wikipedias standards of notability which generally means that the topic has been covered extensively in reliable sources that are independent of the articles subject wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized and therefore must not present original research some subjects such as politicians and academics have specialized notability requirements finally wikipedia must reflect a neutral point of view this is accomplished through summarizing reliable sources using impartial language and ensuring that multiple points of view are presented based on their prominence information must also be verifiable information without citations may be tagged or removed entirely this can at times lead to the removal of information which though valid is not properly sourced as wikipedia policies changed over time and became more complex their number has grown in  there were  policy pages and  guideline pages by  scholars counted  policy pages and  guideline pages governance wikipedias initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements over time an article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor nor by the subject of the article editors in good standing in the community can request extra user rights granting them the technical ability to perform certain special actions some user rights are granted automatically such as the autoconfirmed and extended confirmed groups when thresholds for account age and edits are met administrators experienced editors can choose to run for adminship which includes the ability to delete pages or prevent them from being changed in cases of severe vandalism or editorial disputes administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decisionmaking instead their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have projectwide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors and to implement restrictions intended to prevent disruptive editors from making unproductive edits by  fewer editors were becoming administrators compared to wikipedias earlier years in part because the process of vetting potential administrators had become more rigorous in  there was a particularly contentious request for adminship over the candidates antitrump views ultimately they were granted adminship dispute resolution over time wikipedia has developed a semiformal dispute resolution process to determine community consensus editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums seek outside input through third opinion requests or initiate a more general community discussion known as a request for comment in which bots add the discussion to a centralized list of discussions invite editors to participate and remove the discussion from the list after  days however editors have the discretion to close and delist the discussion early or late if the result of a discussion is not obvious a closeran uninvolved editor usually in good standingmay render a verdict from the strength of the arguments presented and then the numbers of arguers on each side wikipedians emphasize that the process is not a vote by referring to statements of opinion in such discussions as votes in which the exclamation mark is the symbol for logical negation and pronounced not wikipedia encourages local resolutions of conflicts which jemielniak argues is quite unique in organization studies though there has been some recent interest in consensus building in the field reagle and sue gardner argue that the approaches to consensus building are similar to those used by quakers a difference from quaker meetings is the absence of a facilitator in the presence of disagreement a role played by the clerk in quaker meetings arbitration committee the arbitration committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read the arbitration committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted statistical analyses suggest that the english wikipedia committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate therefore the committee does not dictate the content of articles although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates wikipedia policies for example if the new content is considered biased commonly used solutions include cautions and probations used in  of cases and banning editors from articles  subject matters  or wikipedia  complete bans from wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and antisocial behavior when conduct is not impersonation or antisocial but rather edit warring and other violations of editing policies solutions tend to be limited to warnings community each article and each user of wikipedia has an associated and dedicated talk page these form the primary communication channel for editors to discuss coordinate and debate wikipedias community has been described as cultlike although not always with entirely negative connotations its preference for cohesiveness even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of credentials has been referred to as antielitism wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification as wikipedia grew who writes wikipedia became one of the questions frequently asked there jimmy wales once argued that only a community  a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers makes the bulk of contributions to wikipedia and that the project is therefore much like any traditional organization since wikipedia relies on volunteer labour editors frequently focus on topics that interest them the english wikipedia has  articles  registered editors and  active editors an editor is considered active if they have made one or more edits in the past  days editors who fail to comply with wikipedia cultural rituals such as signing talk page comments may implicitly signal that they are wikipedia outsiders increasing the odds that wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions becoming a wikipedia insider involves nontrivial costs the contributor is expected to learn wikipediaspecific technological codes submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process and learn a baffling culture rich with injokes and insider references editors who do not log in are in some sense secondclass citizens on wikipedia as participants are accredited by members of the wiki community who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product on the basis of their ongoing participation but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by their ip addresses cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty new editors often struggle to understand wikipedias complexity experienced editors are encouraged to not bite the newcomers in order to create a more welcoming atmosphere research a  study by researchers from dartmouth college found that anonymous and infrequent contributors to wikipedia  are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site jimmy wales stated in  that it turns out over  of all the edits are done by just  of the users   people  and in fact the most active  which is  people have done  of all the edits however business insider editor and journalist henry blodget showed in  that in a random sample of articles most wikipedia content measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit is created by outsiders while most editing and formatting is done by insiders in  a slate magazine article reported that one percent of wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the sites edits this method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by aaron swartz who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content measured by number of characters contributed by users with low edit counts a  study found that wikipedians were less agreeable open and conscientious than others although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws including that the data showed higher openness and that the differences with the control group and the samples were small according to a  study there is evidence of growing resistance from the wikipedia community to new content diversity several studies have shown that most volunteer wikipedia contributors are male the results of a wikimedia foundation survey in  showed that only  percent of wikipedia editors were female because of this universities throughout the united states tried to encourage women to become wikipedia contributors similarly many of these universities including yale and brown gave college credit to students who create or edit an article relating to women in science or technology andrew lih a professor and scientist said that the reason he thought the number of male contributors outnumbered the number of females so greatly was because identifying as a woman may expose oneself to ugly intimidating behavior data has shown that africans are underrepresented among wikipedia editors language editions there are currently  language editions of wikipedia also called language versions or simply wikipedias as of february  the six largest in order of article count are the english cebuano german french swedish and dutch wikipedias the second and fifthlargest wikipedias owe their position to the articlecreating bot lsjbot which as of  had created about half the articles on the swedish wikipedia and most of the articles in the cebuano and waray wikipedias the latter are both languages of the philippines in addition to the top six twelve other wikipedias have more than a million articles each spanish russian italian polish egyptian arabic chinese japanese ukrainian vietnamese arabic waray and portuguese seven more have over  articles persian chechen catalan indonesian korean serbian and norwegian  more have over  and  more have over  the largest the english wikipedia has over  million articles as of january  the english wikipedia receives  of wikipedias cumulative traffic with the remaining split among the other languages the top  editions represent approximately  of the total traffic since wikipedia is based on the web and therefore worldwide contributors to the same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries as is the case for the english edition these differences may lead to some conflicts over spelling differences eg colour versus color or points of view though the various language editions are held to global policies such as neutral point of view they diverge on some points of policy and practice most notably on whether images that are not licensed freely may be used under a claim of fair use the content of articles on the same subject can differ significantly between languages depending on the sources editors use and other factors jimmy wales has described wikipedia as an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language though each language edition functions more or less independently some efforts are made to supervise them all they are coordinated in part by metawiki the wikimedia foundations wiki devoted to maintaining all its projects wikipedia and others for instance metawiki provides important statistics on all language editions of wikipedia and it maintains a list of articles every wikipedia should have the list concerns basic content by subject biography history geography society culture science technology and mathematics it is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition for example articles about small towns in the united states might be available only in english even when they meet the notability criteria of other language wikipedia projects translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions in part because those editions do not allow fully automated translation of articles articles available in more than one language may offer interwiki links which link to the counterpart articles in other editions a study published by plos one in  also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of wikipedia from different regions of the world it reported that the proportion of the edits made from north america was  for the english wikipedia and  for the simple english wikipedia english wikipedia editor numbers on march   the economist in an article titled the future of wikipedia cited a trend analysis concerning data published by the wikimedia foundation stating that the number of editors for the englishlanguage version has fallen by a third in seven years the attrition rate for active editors in english wikipedia was cited by the economist as substantially in contrast to statistics for wikipedia in other languages nonenglish wikipedia the economist reported that the number of contributors with an average of five or more edits per month was relatively constant since  for wikipedia in other languages at approximately  editors within narrow seasonal variances of about  editors up or down the number of active editors in english wikipedia by sharp comparison was cited as peaking in  at approximately  and dropping to  by the start of  in contrast the trend analysis for wikipedia in other languages nonenglish wikipedia shows success in retaining active editors on a renewable and sustained basis with their numbers remaining relatively constant at approximately  no comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy standards from wikipedia in other languages nonenglish wikipedia would provide a possible alternative to english wikipedia for effectively improving substantial editor attrition rates on the englishlanguage wikipedia reception various wikipedians have criticized wikipedias large and growing regulation which includes more than fifty policies and nearly  words as of  critics have stated that wikipedia exhibits systemic bias in  columnist and journalist edwin black described wikipedia as being a mixture of truth halftruth and some falsehoods articles in the chronicle of higher education and the journal of academic librarianship have criticized wikipedias undueweight policy concluding that wikipedia explicitly is not designed to provide correct information about a subject but rather focus on all the major viewpoints on the subject give less attention to minor ones and creates omissions that can lead to false beliefs based on incomplete information journalists oliver kamm and edwin black alleged in  and  respectively that articles are dominated by the loudest and most persistent voices usually by a group with an ax to grind on the topic a  article in education next journal concluded that as a resource about controversial topics wikipedia is subject to manipulation and spin in  omer benjakob and stephen harrison noted that media coverage of wikipedia has radically shifted over the past two decades once cast as an intellectual frivolity it is now lauded as the last bastion of shared reality online multiple news networks and pundits have accused wikipedia of being ideologically biased in february  fox news accused wikipedia of whitewashing communism and socialism and having too much leftist bias wikipedia cofounder larry sanger who left wikipedia in  to establish competing websites has said that wikipedia had become propaganda for the leftleaning establishment and warned the site can no longer be trusted in  libertarian john stossel opined that wikipedia a site he financially supported at one time appeared to have gradually taken a significant turn in bias to the political left specifically on political topics some studies suggest that wikipedia and in particular the english wikipedia has a western cultural bias or prowestern bias or eurocentric bias reiterating says anna samoilenko similar biases that are found in the ivory tower of academic historiography carwil bjorkjames proposes that wikipedia could follow the diversification pattern of contemporary scholarship and dangzhi zhao calls for a decolonization of wikipedia to reduce bias from opinionated white male editors nine theses on wikipedia nine theses refers to a reform proposal published by larry sanger in october  sangers nine theses on wikipedia presents a critical assessment and reform agenda for wikipedia the proposal is part of his broader effort to address what sanger perceives as systemic issues within wikipedia which includes ideological bias lack of transparency in the editor hierarchies and an ineffective consensusbased decision making procedure accuracy of content articles for traditional encyclopedias such as encyclopdia britannica are written by experts lending such encyclopedias a reputation for accuracy however a peer review in  of fortytwo scientific entries on both wikipedia and encyclopdia britannica by the science journal nature found few differences in accuracy and concluded that the average science entry in wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies britannica about three joseph reagle suggested that while the study reflects a topical strength of wikipedia contributors in science articles wikipedia may not have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on humanities subjects others raised similar critiques the findings by nature were disputed by encyclopdia britannica and in response nature gave a rebuttal of the points raised by britannica in addition to the pointforpoint disagreement between these two parties others have examined the sample size and selection method used in the nature effort and suggested a flawed study design in natures manual selection of articles in part or in whole for comparison absence of statistical analysis eg of reported confidence intervals and a lack of study statistical power ie owing to small sample size  or    articles compared vs  and  set sizes for britannica and the english wikipedia respectively as a consequence of the open structure wikipedia makes no guarantee of validity of its content since no one is ultimately responsible for any claims appearing in it concerns have been raised by pc world in  regarding the lack of accountability that results from users anonymity the insertion of false information vandalism and similar problems legal research in a nutshell  cites wikipedia as a general source that can be a real boon in coming up to speed in the law governing a situation and while not authoritative can provide basic facts as well as leads to more indepth resources economist tyler cowen wrote if i had to guess whether wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true after a not so long think i would opt for wikipedia he comments that some traditional sources of nonfiction suffer from systemic biases and novel results in his opinion are overreported in journal articles as well as relevant information being omitted from news reports however he also cautions that errors are frequently found on internet sites and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them amy bruckman has argued that due to the number of reviewers the content of a popular wikipedia page is actually the most reliable form of information ever created in september  the sydney morning herald journalist liam mannix noted that theres no reason to expect wikipedia to be accurate  and yet it is mannix further discussed the multiple studies that have proved wikipedia to be generally as reliable as encyclopdia britannica summarizing that turning our back on such an extraordinary resource is well a little petty critics argue that wikipedias open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable some commentators suggest that wikipedia may be reliable but that the reliability of any given article is not clear editors of traditional reference works such as the encyclopdia britannica have questioned the projects utility and status as an encyclopedia wikipedia cofounder jimmy wales has claimed that wikipedia has largely avoided the problem of fake news because the wikipedia community regularly debates the quality of sources in articles wikipedias open structure inherently makes it an easy target for internet trolls spammers and various forms of paid advocacy seen as counterproductive to the maintenance of a neutral and verifiable online encyclopedia in response to paid advocacy editing and undisclosed editing issues wikipedia was reported in an article in the wall street journal to have strengthened its rules and laws against undisclosed editing the article stated that beginning monday from the date of the article june   changes in wikipedias terms of use will require anyone paid to edit articles to disclose that arrangement katherine maher the nonprofit wikimedia foundations chief communications officer said the changes address a sentiment among volunteer editors that were not an advertising service were an encyclopedia these issues among others had been parodied since the first decade of wikipedia notably by stephen colbert on the colbert report discouragement in education some university lecturers discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in academic work preferring primary sources some specifically prohibit wikipedia citations wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate to use as citable sources and should not be relied upon as authoritative wales once  or earlier said he receives about ten emails weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited wikipedia he told the students they got what they deserved for gods sake youre in college dont cite the encyclopedia he said in february  an article in the harvard crimson newspaper reported that a few of the professors at harvard university were including wikipedia articles in their syllabi although without realizing the articles might change in june  michael gorman former president of the american library association condemned wikipedia along with google stating that academics who endorse the use of wikipedia are the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of big macs with everything a  research study published in studies in higher education argued that wikipedia could be applied in the higher education flipped classroom an educational model where students learn before coming to class and apply it in classroom activities the experimental group was instructed to learn before class and get immediate feedback before going in the flipped classroom model while the control group was given direct instructions in class the conventional classroom model the groups were then instructed to collaboratively develop wikipedia entries which would be graded in quality after the study the results showed that the experimental group yielded more wikipedia entries and received higher grades in quality the study concluded that learning with wikipedia in flipped classrooms was more effective than in conventional classrooms demonstrating wikipedia could be used as an educational tool in higher education medical information on march   julie beck writing for the atlantic magazine in an article titled doctors  source for healthcare information wikipedia stated that fifty percent of physicians look up conditions on the wikipedia site and some are editing articles themselves to improve the quality of available information beck continued to detail in this article new programs of amin azzam at the university of san francisco to offer medical school courses to medical students for learning to edit and improve wikipedia articles on healthrelated issues as well as internal quality control programs within wikipedia organized by james heilman to improve a group of  healthrelated articles of central medical importance up to wikipedias highest standard of articles using its featured article and good article peerreview evaluation process in a may   followup article in the atlantic titled can wikipedia ever be a definitive medical text julie beck quotes wikiproject medicines james heilman as stating just because a reference is peerreviewed doesnt mean its a highquality reference beck added that wikipedia has its own peer review process before articles can be classified as good or featured heilman who has participated in that process before says less than one percent of wikipedias medical articles have passed coverage of topics and systemic bias wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia with each topic covered encyclopedically in one article since it has terabytes of disk space it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia the exact degree and manner of coverage on wikipedia is under constant review by its editors and disagreements are not uncommon see deletionism and inclusionism wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable offensive or pornographic the wikipedia is not censored policy has sometimes proved controversial in  wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of images of muhammad in the english edition of its muhammad article citing this policy the presence of politically religiously and pornographically sensitive materials in wikipedia has led to the censorship of wikipedia by national authorities in china and pakistan among other countries through its wikipedia loves libraries program wikipedia has partnered with major public libraries such as the new york public library for the performing arts to expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and articles a  study conducted by researchers at the university of minnesota indicated that male and female editors focus on different coverage topics there was a greater concentration of females in the people and arts category while males focus more on geography and science an editorial in the guardian in  claimed that more effort went into providing references for a list of female porn actors than a list of women writers systemic biases wikipedias policies may limit its capacity for truly representing global knowledge for example wikipedia only considers published sources to be reliable oral knowledge of indigenous cultures is not always reflected in print marginalized topics are also more likely to lack significant coverage in reliable sources wikipedias content is therefore limited as a result of larger systemic biases academic studies of wikipedia have shown that the average contributor to the english wikipedia is an educated technically inclined white male aged  from a developed predominantly christian country the corresponding point of view pov is overrepresented this systemic bias in editor demographic results in cultural bias gender bias and geographical bias on wikipedia there are two broad types of bias which are implicit when a topic is omitted and explicit when a certain pov is overrepresented in an article or by references interdisciplinary scholarly assessments of wikipedia articles have found that while articles are typically accurate and free of misinformation they are also typically incomplete and fail to present all perspectives with a neutral point of view in  wales claimed that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors citing for example biographies of famous women through history and issues surrounding early childcare the october   essay by tom simonite in mits technology review titled the decline of wikipedia discussed the effect of systemic bias and policy creep on the downward trend in the number of editors research conducted by mark graham of the oxford internet institute in  indicated that the geographic distribution of article topics is highly uneven with africa being the most underrepresented across  language editions of wikipedia historical articles and sections are generally eurocentric and focused on recent events explicit content wikipedia has been criticized for allowing information about graphic content articles depicting what some critics have called objectionable content such as feces cadaver human penis vulva and nudity contain graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with access to the internet including children the site also includes sexual content such as images and videos of masturbation and ejaculation illustrations of zoophilia and photos from hardcore pornographic films in its articles it also has nonsexual photographs of nude children the wikipedia article about virgin killera  album from the german rock band scorpionsfeatures a picture of the albums original cover which depicts a naked prepubescent girl the original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries in december  access to the wikipedia article virgin killer was blocked for four days by most internet service providers in the united kingdom after the internet watch foundation iwf decided the album cover was a potentially illegal indecent image and added the articles url to a blacklist it supplies to british internet service providers in april  sanger wrote a letter to the federal bureau of investigation outlining his concerns that two categories of images on wikimedia commons contained child pornography and were in violation of us federal obscenity law sanger later clarified that the images which were related to pedophilia and one about lolicon were not of real children but said that they constituted obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children under the protect act of  that law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are obscene under american law sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on wikipedia in schools wikimedia foundation spokesman jay walsh strongly rejected sangers accusation saying that wikipedia did not have material we would deem to be illegal if we did we would remove it following the complaint by sanger wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community after some editors who volunteered to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his cofounder status he wrote in a message to the wikimedia foundation mailinglist that this action was in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophicalcontent issues rather than be about me and how quickly i acted critics including wikipediocracy noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from wikipedia since  have reappeared privacy one privacy concern in the case of wikipedia regards ones right to remain a private citizen rather than a public figure in the eyes of the law it is a battle between the right to be anonymous in cyberspace and the right to be anonymous in real life the wikimedia foundations privacy policy states we believe that you shouldnt have to provide personal information to participate in the free knowledge movement and states that personal information may be shared for legal reasons to protect you ourselves  others or to understand  experiment in january  a german court ordered the german wikipedia shut down within germany because it stated the full name of boris floricic aka tron a deceased hacker on february   the injunction against wikimedia deutschland was overturned with the court rejecting the notion that trons right to privacy or that of his parents was being violated wikipedia has a volunteer response team that uses znuny a free and opensource software fork of otrs to handle queries without having to reveal the identities of the involved parties this is used for example in confirming the permission for using individual images and other media in the project in late april  wikimedia foundation announced that wikipedia will not submit to any age verifications that may be required by the uks online safety bill legislation rebecca mackinnon of the wikimedia foundation said that such checks would run counter to the websites commitment to minimal data collection on its contributors and readers sexism wikipedia was described in  as harboring a battleground culture of sexism and harassment the perceived tolerance of abusive language was a reason put forth in  for the gender gap in wikipedia editorship editathons have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of womens topics in may  a wikipedia editor rejected a submitted article about donna strickland due to lack of coverage in the media five months later strickland won a nobel prize in physics for groundbreaking inventions in the field of laser physics becoming the third woman to ever receive the award prior to winning the award stricklands only mention on wikipedia was in the article about her collaborator and cowinner of the award gerard mourou her exclusion from wikipedia led to accusations of sexism but corinne purtill writing for quartz argued that its also a pointed lesson in the hazards of gender bias in media and of the broader consequences of underrepresentation purtill attributes the issue to the gender bias in media coverage a comprehensive  survey published in  by julia b bear of stony brook universitys college of business and benjamin collier of carnegie mellon university found significant gender differences in confidence in expertise discomfort with editing and response to critical feedback women reported less confidence in their expertise expressed greater discomfort with editing which typically involves conflict and reported more negative responses to critical feedback compared to men operation wikimedia foundation and affiliate movements wikipedia is hosted and funded by the wikimedia foundation a nonprofit organization which also operates wikipediarelated projects such as wiktionary and wikibooks the foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission the foundations  internal revenue service form  shows revenue of  million and expenses of almost  million with assets of about  million and liabilities of almost  million in may  wikimedia foundation named lila tretikov as its second executive director taking over for sue gardner the wall street journal reported on may   that tretikovs information technology background from her years at university of california offers wikipedia an opportunity to develop in more concentrated directions guided by her often repeated position statement that information like air wants to be free the same wall street journal article reported these directions of development according to an interview with spokesman jay walsh of wikimedia who said tretikov would address that issue paid advocacy as a priority we are really pushing toward more transparency  we are reinforcing that paid advocacy is not welcome initiatives to involve greater diversity of contributors better mobile support of wikipedia new geolocation tools to find local content more easily and more tools for users in the second and third world are also priorities walsh said following the departure of tretikov from wikipedia due to issues concerning the use of the superprotection feature which some language versions of wikipedia have adopted katherine maher became the third executive director of the wikimedia foundation in june  maher stated that one of her priorities would be the issue of editor harassment endemic to wikipedia as identified by the wikipedia board in december she said to bloomberg businessweek regarding the harassment issue that it establishes a sense within the community that this is a priority  and that correction requires that it has to be more than words maher served as executive director until april  maryana iskander was named the incoming ceo in september  and took over that role in january  she stated that one of her focuses would be increasing diversity in the wikimedia community wikipedia is also supported by many organizations and groups that are affiliated with the wikimedia foundation but independentlyrun called wikimedia movement affiliates these include wikimedia chapters which are national or subnational organizations such as wikimedia deutschland and wikimedia france thematic organizations such as amical wikimedia for the catalan language community and user groups these affiliates participate in the promotion development and funding of wikipedia software operations and support the operation of wikipedia depends on mediawiki a custommade free and open source wiki software platform written in php and built upon the mysql database system the software incorporates programming features such as a macro language variables a transclusion system for templates and url redirection mediawiki is licensed under the gnu general public license gpl and it is used by all wikimedia projects as well as many other wiki projects originally wikipedia ran on usemodwiki written in perl by clifford adams phase i which initially required camelcase for article hyperlinks the present double bracket style was incorporated later starting in january  phase ii wikipedia began running on a php wiki engine with a mysql database this software was custommade for wikipedia by magnus manske the phase ii software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand in july  phase iii wikipedia shifted to the thirdgeneration software mediawiki originally written by lee daniel crocker several mediawiki extensions are installed to extend the functionality of the mediawiki software in april  a lucene extension was added to mediawikis builtin search and wikipedia switched from mysql to lucene for searching lucene was later replaced by cirrussearch which is based on elasticsearch in july  after extensive beta testing a wysiwyg what you see is what you get extension visualeditor was opened to public use it was met with much rejection and criticism and was described as slow and buggy the feature was changed from optout to optin afterward automated editing computer programs called bots have often been used to perform simple and repetitive tasks such as correcting common misspellings and stylistic issues or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data one controversial contributor sverker johansson created articles with his bot lsjbot which was reported to create up to  articles on the swedish wikipedia on certain days additionally there are bots designed to automatically notify editors when they make common editing errors such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parentheses edits falsely identified by bots as the work of a banned editor can be restored by other editors an antivandal bot is programmed to detect and revert vandalism quickly bots are able to indicate edits from particular accounts or ip address ranges as occurred at the time of the shooting down of the mh jet in july  when it was reported that edits were made via ips controlled by the russian government bots on wikipedia must be approved before activation according to andrew lih the current expansion of wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the use of such bots hardware operations and support as of  page requests are first passed to a frontend layer of varnish caching servers and backend layer caching is done by apache traffic server requests that cannot be served from the varnish cache are sent to loadbalancing servers running the linux virtual server software which in turn pass them to one of the apache web servers for page rendering from the database the web servers deliver pages as requested performing page rendering for all the language editions of wikipedia to increase speed further rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses wikipedia currently runs on dedicated clusters of linux servers running the debian operating system by january   wikipedia had migrated its primary data center to an equinix facility in ashburn virginia a second application data center was created in  in carrollton texas to improve wikipedias reliability both datacenters work as the primary one in alternate semesters with the other one working as secondary datacenter in  wikipedia installed a caching cluster in an equinix facility in singapore the first of its kind in asia in  a caching data center was opened in marseille france in  a caching data center was opened in sao paulo the first of its kind in south america as of november  caching clusters are located in amsterdam san francisco singapore marseille and sao paulo internal research and operational development following growing amounts of incoming donations in  exceeding seven digits the foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its consideration under the principles of industrial organization economics to indicate the need for the reinvestment of donations into the internal research and development of the foundation two projects of such internal research and development have been the creation of a visual editor and the thank tab in the edit history which were developed to improve issues of editor attrition the estimates for reinvestment by industrial organizations into internal research and development was studied by adam jaffe who recorded that the range of  to  annually was to be recommended with highend technology requiring the higher level of support for internal reinvestment at the  level of contributions for wikimedia presently documented as  million dollars the computed budget level recommended by jaffe for reinvestment into internal research and development is between  million and  million dollars annually in  the level of contributions were reported by the wikimedia foundation as being at  million annually updating the jaffe estimates for the higher level of support to between  million and  million annually internal news publications multiple wikimedia projects have internal news publications wikimedias online newspaper the signpost was founded in  by michael snow a wikipedia administrator who would join the wikimedia foundations board of trustees in  the publication covers news and events from the english wikipedia the wikimedia foundation and wikipedias sister projects the wikipedia library wikipedia editors sometimes struggle to access paywalled sources needed to improve a subject the wikipedia library is a resource for wikipedia editors which provides free access to a wide range of digital publications so that they can consult and cite these while editing the encyclopedia over  publishers have partnered with the wikipedia library to provide access to their resources when ice publishing joined in  a spokesman said by enabling free access to our content for wikipedia editors we hope to further the research communitys resources  creating and updating wikipedia entries on civil engineering which are read by thousands of monthly readers access to content content licensing when the project was started in  all text in wikipedia was covered by the gnu free documentation license gfdl a copyleft license permitting the redistribution creation of derivative works and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work the gfdl was created for software manuals that come with free software programs licensed under the gpl this made it a poor choice for a general reference work for example the gfdl requires the reprints of materials from wikipedia to come with a full copy of the gfdl text in december  the creative commons license was released it was specifically designed for creative works in general not just for software manuals the wikipedia project sought the switch to the creative commons because the gfdl and creative commons were incompatible in november  following the request of the project the free software foundation fsf released a new version of the gfdl designed specifically to allow wikipedia to relicense its content to cc bysa by august   in april  wikipedia and its sister projects held a communitywide referendum which decided the switch in june  the handling of media files eg image files varies across language editions some language editions such as the english wikipedia include nonfree image files under fair use doctrine while the others have opted not to in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries eg in japanese copyright law media files covered by free content licenses eg creative commons cc bysa are shared across language editions via wikimedia commons repository a project operated by the wikimedia foundation wikipedias accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text the wikimedia foundation is not a licensor of content on wikipedia or its related projects but merely a hosting service for contributors to and licensors of wikipedia a position which was successfully defended in  in a court in france methods of access since wikipedia content is distributed under an open license anyone can reuse or redistribute it at no charge the content of wikipedia has been published in many forms both online and offline outside the wikipedia website thousands of mirror sites exist that republish content from wikipedia two prominent ones that also include content from other reference sources are referencecom and answerscom another example is wapedia which began to display wikipedia content in a mobiledevicefriendly format before wikipedia itself did some web search engines make special use of wikipedia content when displaying search results examples include microsoft bing via technology gained from powerset and duckduckgo collections of wikipedia articles have been published on optical discs an english version released in  contained about  articles the polishlanguage version from  contains nearly  articles the germanlanguage version from  contains over  articles and the spanishlanguage version from  contains  articles additionally wikipedia for schools the wikipedia series of cds  dvds produced by wikipedia and sos children is a free selection from wikipedia designed for education towards children eight to seventeen there have been efforts to put a select subset of wikipedias articles into printed book form since  tens of thousands of printondemand books that reproduced english german russian and french wikipedia articles have been produced by the american company books llc and by three mauritian subsidiaries of the german publisher vdm the website dbpedia begun in  extracts data from the infoboxes and category declarations of the englishlanguage wikipedia wikimedia has created the wikidata project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts from each page of wikipedia and other wikimedia foundation projects and make it available in a queryable semantic format rdf as of february  it has over  million items wikireader is a dedicated reader device that contains an offline copy of wikipedia which was launched by openmoko and first released in  obtaining the full contents of wikipedia for reuse presents challenges since direct cloning via a web crawler is discouraged wikipedia publishes dumps of its contents but these are textonly as of  there is no dump available of wikipedias images wikimedia enterprise is a forprofit solution to this several languages of wikipedia also maintain a reference desk where volunteers answer questions from the general public according to a study by pnina shachaf in the journal of documentation the quality of the wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard library reference desk with an accuracy of  percent mobile access wikipedias original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard web browser through a fixed internet connection although wikipedia content has been accessible through the mobile web since july  the new york times on february   quoted erik moller deputy director of the wikimedia foundation stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry the article in the new york times reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that only  percent of the readership of the englishlanguage wikipedia comes via mobile devices a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites many of which approach  percent and the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more in  the new york times reported that moller has assigned a team of  software developers focused on mobile out of a total of approximately  employees working at the wikimedia foundation one principal concern cited by the new york times for the worry is for wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment by  the wikimedia foundations staff had grown to over  employees access to wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as  through the wireless application protocol wap via the wapedia service in june  wikipedia launched enmobilewikipediaorg an official website for wireless devices in  a newer mobile service was officially released located at enmwikipediaorg which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the iphone androidbased devices or webosbased devices several other methods of mobile access to wikipedia have emerged since many devices and applications optimize or enhance the display of wikipedia content for mobile devices while some also incorporate additional features such as use of wikipedia metadata like geoinformation the android app for wikipedia was released in january  to over  installs and generally positive reviews scoring over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately  users downloading from google the version for ios was released on april   to similar reviews wikipedia zero was an initiative of the wikimedia foundation to expand the reach of the encyclopedia to the developing countries by partnering with mobile operators to allow free access it was discontinued in february  due to lack of participation from mobile operators andrew lih and andrew brown both maintain editing wikipedia with smartphones is difficult and this discourages new potential contributors lih states that the number of wikipedia editors has been declining after several years and tom simonite of mit technology review claims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this simonite alleges some wikipedians use the labyrinthine rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors have a vested interest in keeping the status quo lih alleges there is a serious disagreement among existing contributors on how to resolve this lih fears for wikipedias longterm future while brown fears problems with wikipedia will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it chinese access access to wikipedia has been blocked in mainland china since may  this was done after wikipedia started to use https encryption which made selective censorship more difficult cultural influence trusted source to combat fake news in  after a barrage of false news reports both facebook and youtube announced they would rely on wikipedia to help their users evaluate reports and reject false news noam cohen writing in the washington post states youtubes reliance on wikipedia to set the record straight builds on the thinking of another factchallenged platform the facebook social network which announced last year that wikipedia would help its users root out fake news readership in february  the new york times reported that wikipedia was ranked fifth globally among all websites stating with  billion page views and nearly  million unique visitors a month  wikipedia trails just yahoo facebook microsoft and google the largest with  billion unique visitors however its ranking dropped to th globally by june  due mostly to a rise in popularity of chinese websites for online shopping the website has since recovered its ranking as of april  in addition to logistic growth in the number of its articles wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in  the number of readers of wikipedia worldwide reached  million at the end of  the pew internet and american life project found that one third of us internet users consulted wikipedia in  business insider gave wikipedia a valuation of  billion if it ran advertisements according to wikipedia readership survey  the average age of wikipedia readers is  with a rough parity between genders almost half of wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month and a similar number of readers specifically look for wikipedia in search engine results about  percent of wikipedia readers do not realize that wikipedia is a nonprofit organization as of february  wikipedia attracts around  billion unique devices monthly with the english wikipedia receiving  billion pageviews each month covid pandemic during the covid pandemic wikipedias coverage of the pandemic and fight against misinformation received international media attention and brought an increase in wikipedia readership overall noam cohen wrote in wired that wikipedias effort to combat misinformation related to the pandemic was different from other major websites opining unless twitter facebook and the others can learn to address misinformation more effectively wikipedia will remain the last best place on the internet in october  the world health organization announced they were freely licensing its infographics and other materials on wikimedia projects there were nearly  covid related wikipedia articles across  different wikipedias as of november  cultural significance wikipedias content has also been used in academic studies books conferences and court cases the parliament of canadas website refers to wikipedias article on samesex marriage in the related links section of its further reading list for the civil marriage act the encyclopedias assertions are increasingly used as a source by organizations such as the us federal courts and the world intellectual property organizationthough mainly for supporting information rather than information decisive to a case content appearing on wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in some us intelligence agency reports in december  the scientific journal rna biology launched a new section for descriptions of families of rna molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also submit a draft article on the rna family for publication in wikipedia wikipedia has also been used as a source in journalism often without attribution and several reporters have been dismissed for plagiarizing from wikipedia in  time magazine recognized wikipedias participation along with youtube reddit myspace and facebook in the rapid growth of online collaboration and interaction by millions of people worldwide on september   the washington post reported that wikipedia had become a focal point in the  us election campaign saying type a candidates name into google and among the first results is a wikipedia page making those entries arguably as important as any ad in defining a candidate already the presidential entries are being edited dissected and debated countless times each day an october  reuters article titled wikipedia page the latest status symbol reported the recent phenomenon of how having a wikipedia article vindicates ones notability one of the first times wikipedia was involved in a governmental affair was on september   when italian politician franco grillini raised a parliamentary question with the minister of cultural resources and activities about the necessity of freedom of panorama he said that the lack of such freedom forced wikipedia the seventh most consulted website to forbid all images of modern italian buildings and art and claimed this was hugely damaging to tourist revenues a working group led by peter stone formed as a part of the stanfordbased project one hundred year study on artificial intelligence in its report called wikipedia the bestknown example of crowdsourcing  that far exceeds traditionallycompiled information sources such as encyclopedias and dictionaries in scale and depth in a  opinion piece for wired hossein derakhshan describes wikipedia as one of the last remaining pillars of the open and decentralized web and contrasted its existence as a textbased source of knowledge with social media and social networking services the latter having since colonized the web for televisions values for derakhshan wikipedias goal as an encyclopedia represents the age of enlightenment tradition of rationality triumphing over emotions a trend which he considers endangered due to the gradual shift from a typographic culture to a photographic one which in turn means a shift from rationality to emotions exposition to entertainment rather than sapere aude lit dare to know social networks have led to a culture of dare not to care to know this is while wikipedia faces a more concerning problem than funding namely a flattening growth rate in the number of contributors to the website consequently the challenge for wikipedia and those who use it is to save wikipedia and its promise of a free and open collection of all human knowledge amid the conquest of new and old televisionhow to collect and preserve knowledge when nobody cares to know awards wikipedia has won many awards receiving its first two major awards in may  the first was a golden nica for digital communities of the annual prix ars electronica contest this came with a    grant and an invitation to present at the pae cyberarts festival in austria later that year the second was a judges webby award for the community category in september  wikipedia received quadriga a mission of enlightenment award of werkstatt deutschland along with boris tadic eckart hofling and peter gabriel the award was presented to wales by david weinberger in  wikipedia was awarded both the annual erasmus prize which recognizes exceptional contributions to culture society or social sciences and the spanish princess of asturias award on international cooperation speaking at the asturian parliament in oviedo the city that hosts the awards ceremony jimmy wales praised the work of the asturian wikipedia users satire comedian stephen colbert has parodied or referenced wikipedia on numerous episodes of his show the colbert report and coined the related term wikiality meaning together we can create a reality that we all agree onthe reality we just agreed on another example can be found in wikipedia celebrates  years of american independence a july  frontpage article in the onion as well as the  the onion article la law wikipedia page viewed  times today in an april  episode of the american television comedy the office office manager michael scott is shown relying on a hypothetical wikipedia article for information on negotiation tactics to assist him in negotiating lesser pay for an employee viewers of the show tried to add the episodes mention of the page as a section of the actual wikipedia article on negotiation but this effort was prevented by other users on the articles talk page my number one doctor a  episode of the television show scrubs played on the perception that wikipedia is an unreliable reference tool with a scene in which perry cox reacts to a patient who says that a wikipedia article indicates that the raw food diet reverses the effects of bone cancer by retorting that the same editor who wrote that article also wrote the battlestar galactica episode guide in  the comedy website collegehumor produced a video sketch named professor wikipedia in which the fictitious professor wikipedia instructs a class with a medley of unverifiable and occasionally absurd statements the dilbert comic strip from may   features a character supporting an improbable claim by saying give me ten minutes and then check wikipedia in july  bbc radio  broadcast a comedy series called bigipedia which was set on a website which was a parody of wikipedia some of the sketches were directly inspired by wikipedia and its articles on august   the new yorker website published a cartoon with this caption dammit manning have you considered the pronoun war that this is going to start on your wikipedia page the cartoon referred to chelsea elizabeth manning born bradley edward manning an american activist politician and former united states army soldier who had recently come out as a trans woman in june  naturecom published a fictional wikipedia talk page under the title plasticeating fungus caused doomsday by emma burnett the talk page concerned a fictional article describing the unintended consequences of the release of a plasticeating fungus to clean up an oil spill the article contained talk page topics found on wikipedia like discussions of changes in the articles priority level publishing the most obvious economic effect of wikipedia has been the death of commercial encyclopedias especially printed versions like encyclopdia britannica which were unable to compete with a free alternative nicholas carrs  essay the amorality of web  criticizes websites with usergenerated content like wikipedia for possibly leading to professional and in his view superior content producers going out of business because free trumps quality all the time carr wrote implicit in the ecstatic visions of web  is the hegemony of the amateur i for one cant imagine anything more frightening others dispute the notion that wikipedia or similar efforts will entirely displace traditional publications chris anderson the former editorinchief of wired wrote in nature that the wisdom of crowds approach of wikipedia will not displace top scientific journals with rigorous peer review processes wikipedias influence on the biography publishing business has been a concern for some book publishing data tracker nielsen bookscan stated in  that biography sales were dropping far more sharply kathryn hughes professor of life writing at the university of east anglia and author of two biographies wrote the worry is that if you can get all that information from wikipedia whats left for biography research use wikipedia has been widely used as a corpus for linguistic research in computational linguistics information retrieval and natural language processing in particular it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for the entity linking problem which is then called wikification and to the related problem of wordsense disambiguation methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find missing links in wikipedia in  french researchers jose lages of the university of franchecomte in besancon and dima shepelyansky of paul sabatier university in toulouse published a global university ranking based on wikipedia scholarly citations they used pagerank cheirank and similar algorithms followed by the number of appearances in the  different language editions of wikipedia descending order and the century in which they were founded ascending order the study was updated in  in december  john julius norwich stated in a letter published in the times newspaper that as a historian he resorted to wikipedia at least a dozen times a day and had never caught it out he described it as a work of reference as useful as any in existence with so wide a range that it is almost impossible to find a person place or thing that it has left uncovered and that he could never have written his last two books without it a  mit study suggests that words used in wikipedia articles end up in scientific publications studies related to wikipedia have been using machine learning and artificial intelligence to support various operations one of the most important areas is the automatic detection of vandalism and data quality assessment in wikipedia related projects several interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before wikipedia was founded the first of these was the  bbc domesday project which included text entered on bbc micro computers and photographs from more than a million contributors in the uk and covered the geography art and culture of the uk this was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the uk the user interface and part of the content of the domesday project were emulated on a website until  several freecontent collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as wikipedia eg everything with many later being merged into the project eg gne one of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was hg which was created by douglas adams in  the hg encyclopedia is relatively lighthearted focusing on articles which are both witty and informative subsequent collaborative knowledge websites have drawn inspiration from wikipedia others use more traditional peer review such as encyclopedia of life and the online wiki encyclopedias scholarpedia and citizendium the latter was started by sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative
