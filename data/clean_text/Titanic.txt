rms titanic was a british ocean liner that sank in the early hours of  april  as a result of striking an iceberg on her maiden voyage from southampton england to new york city united states of the estimated  passengers and crew aboard approximately  died estimates vary making the incident one of the deadliest peacetime sinkings of a single ship titanic operated by white star line carried some of the wealthiest people in the world as well as hundreds of emigrants from the british isles scandinavia and elsewhere in europe who were seeking a new life in the united states and canada the disaster drew public attention spurred major changes in maritime safety regulations and inspired a lasting legacy in popular culture it was the second time white star line had lost a ship on her maiden voyage the first being rms tayleur in  titanic was the largest ship afloat upon entering service and the second of three olympicclass ocean liners built for white star line the ship was built by the harland and wolff shipbuilding company in belfast thomas andrews jr the chief naval architect of the shipyard died in the disaster titanic was under the command of captain edward john smith who went down with the ship white star lines chairman j bruce ismay survived in a lifeboat the firstclass accommodations were designed to be the pinnacle of comfort and luxury they included a gymnasium swimming pool smoking rooms fine restaurants and cafes a victorianstyle turkish bath and hundreds of opulent cabins a highpowered radiotelegraph transmitter was available for passenger use titanic had advanced safety features such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors which contributed to the ships reputation as unsinkable titanic was equipped with sixteen lifeboat davits each capable of lowering three lifeboats for a total capacity of  boats despite this capacity the ship was scantly equipped with a total of only twenty lifeboats fourteen of these were regular lifeboats two were cutter lifeboats and four were collapsible and proved difficult to launch while the ship was sinking together the lifeboats could hold  people  roughly half the number of passengers on board and a third of the number of passengers the ship could have carried at full capacity a number consistent with the maritime safety regulations of the era the british board of trades regulations required fourteen lifeboats for a ship of  tonnes titanic carried six more than required allowing  extra people room in lifeboats when the ship sank the lifeboats that had been lowered were only filled up to an average of  background the name titanic derives from the titans of greek mythology built in belfast ireland in what was then the united kingdom of great britain and ireland rms titanic was the second of the three olympicclass ocean linersthe lead vessel was rms olympic and the final ship in the class was hmhs britannic they were by far the largest vessels of the british shipping company white star lines fleet which comprised  steamers and tenders in  the three ships had their genesis in a discussion in mid between the white star lines chairman j bruce ismay and the american financier j p morgan who controlled the white star lines parent corporation the international mercantile marine co imm white star faced an increasing challenge from its main rivals cunard linewhich with the aid of the admiralty had recently launched the twin sister ships lusitania and mauretania the fastest passenger ships then in serviceand the german lines hamburg america and norddeutscher lloyd ismay preferred to compete on size rather than speed and proposed to commission a new class of liners larger than anything that had come before which would be the last word in comfort and luxury the new ships would have sufficient speed to maintain a weekly service with only three ships instead of the original four olympic and titanic would replace rms teutonic of  rms majestic of  and rms adriatic of  rms oceanic first departed from a new home port in june  along with the teutonic majestic and the new adriatic on the southamptonnew york run the ships were constructed by the belfast shipbuilder harland  wolff which had a longestablished relationship with the white star line dating back to  harland and wolff were given a great deal of latitude in designing ships for the white star line the usual approach was for wilhelm wolff to sketch a general concept which edward james harland would turn into a ship design cost considerations were a relatively low priority harland  wolff were authorised to spend what it needed on the ships plus a five per cent profit margin in the case of the olympicclass ships a cost of  million  million today for the first two ships was agreed plus extras to contract and the usual five per cent fee harland and wolff put their leading designers to work designing olympicclass vessels the design was overseen by lord pirrie a director of both harland and wolff and the white star line naval architect thomas andrews the managing director of harland and wolffs design department edward wilding andrewss deputy and responsible for calculating the ships design stability and trim and alexander carlisle the shipyards chief draughtsman and general manager carlisles responsibilities included the decorations equipment and all general arrangements including the implementation of an efficient lifeboat davit design on  july  harland and wolff presented the drawings to j bruce ismay and other white star line executives ismay approved the design and signed three letters of agreement two days later authorising the start of construction at this point the first shipwhich was later to become olympichad no name but was referred to simply as number  as it was harland and wolffs th hull titanic was based on a revised version of the same design and was given the number  dimensions and layout titanic was  feet  inches  m long with a maximum breadth of  feet  inches  m the ships total height measured from the base of the keel to the top of the bridge was  feet  m titanic measured  grt and  nrt and with a draught of  feet  inches  m and displaced  tonnes all three of the olympicclass ships had ten decks excluding the top of the officers quarters eight of which were for passenger use from top to bottom the decks were the boat deck on which the lifeboats were housed it was from here during the early hours of  april  that titanics lifeboats were lowered into the north atlantic the bridge and wheelhouse were at the forward end in front of the captains and officers quarters the bridge stood  feet  m above the deck extending out to either side so that the ship could be controlled while docking the wheelhouse stood within the bridge the entrance to the first class grand staircase and gymnasium was located midships along with the raised roof of the first class lounge while at the rear of the deck were the roof of the first class smoke room and the second class entrance just forward of the second class entrance sat the kennels where the first class passengers dogs would stay the woodcovered deck was divided into four segregated promenades for officers first class passengers engineers and second class passengers respectively lifeboats lined the side of the deck except in the first class area where there was a gap so that the view would not be spoiled a deck also called the promenade deck extended along the entire  feet  m length of the superstructure it was reserved exclusively for first class passengers and contained first class cabins the first class reading and writing room lounge smoke room and palm court b deck the bridge deck was the top weightbearing deck and the uppermost level of the hull more first class passenger accommodations were located here with six palatial staterooms cabins featuring their own private promenades on titanic the a la carte restaurant and the cafe parisien provided luxury dining facilities to first class passengers both were run by subcontracted chefs and their staff all were lost in the disaster the second class smoking room and entrance hall were both located on this deck the raised forecastle of the ship was forward of the bridge deck accommodating number  hatch the main hatch through to the cargo holds numerous pieces of machinery and the anchor housings aft of the bridge deck was the raised poop deck  feet  m long used as a promenade by third class passengers it was where many of titanics passengers and crew made their last stand as the ship sank the forecastle and poop deck were separated from the bridge deck by well decks c deck the shelter deck was the highest deck to run uninterrupted from stem to stern it included both well decks the aft one served as part of the thirdclass promenade crew cabins were housed below the forecastle and thirdclass public rooms were housed below the poop deck in between were the majority of first class cabins and the secondclass library d deck the saloon deck was dominated by three public roomsthe firstclass reception room the firstclass dining saloon and the secondclass dining saloon the first and secondclass galleys were also located on this deck an open space was provided for third class passengers first second and thirdclass passengers had cabins on this deck with berths for firemen located in the bow it was the highest level reached by the ships watertight bulkheads though only by eight of the fifteen bulkheads e deck the upper deck was predominantly used for passenger accommodation for all three classes plus berths for cooks seamen stewards and trimmers along its length ran a long passageway nicknamed scotland road in reference to a famous street in liverpool scotland road was used by third class passengers and crew members f deck the middle deck mainly accommodated second and thirdclass passengers and several departments of the crew the third class dining saloon was located here as was the first class bath complex containing the swimming pool and the turkish bath g deck the lower deck had the lowest portholes just above the waterline the firstclass squash court was located here along with the travelling post office where letters and parcels were sorted ready for delivery when the ship docked food was also stored here the deck was interrupted at several points by orlop partial decks over the boiler engine and turbine rooms the orlop deck and the tank top below that named because of the water tanks and ballast tanks stored in the ships double bottomwere on the lowest level of the ship below the waterline the orlop decks were used as cargo spaces while the tank topthe inner bottom of the ships hullprovided the platform on which the ships boilers engines turbines and electrical generators were housed this area of the ship was occupied by the engine and boiler rooms areas which passengers would have been prohibited from seeing they were connected with higher levels of the ship by two flights of stairs in the firemans passage twin spiral stairways near the bow provided access up to d deck ladders in the boiler turbine and engine rooms provided access to higher decks in those compartments features power titanic propulsion was supplied by three main enginestwo reciprocating fourcylinder tripleexpansion steam engines and one centrally placed lowpressure parsons turbineeach driving a propeller the two reciprocating engines had a combined output of  horsepower  kw the output of the steam turbine was  horsepower  kw the white star line had used the same combination of engines on an earlier liner laurentic where it had been a great success it provided a good combination of performance and speed reciprocating engines by themselves were not powerful enough to propel an olympicclass liner at the desired speeds while turbines were sufficiently powerful but caused uncomfortable vibrations a problem that affected the allturbine cunard liners lusitania and mauretania by combining reciprocating engines with a turbine fuel usage could be reduced and motive power increased while using the same amount of steam the two reciprocating engines were each  feet  m long and weighed  tonnes with their bedplates contributing a further  tonnes they were powered by steam produced in  boilers  of which were doubleended and five singleended which contained a total of  furnaces the boilers were  feet  inches  m in diameter and  feet  m long each weighing  tonnes and capable of holding  tonnes of water they were fuelled by burning coal  tonnes of which could be carried in titanics bunkers with a further  tonnes in hold  the furnaces required over  tonnes of coal a day to be shovelled into them by hand requiring the services of  firemen working around the clock  tonnes of ash a day had to be disposed of by ejecting it into the sea the work was relentless dirty and dangerous and although firemen were paid relatively well there was a high suicide rate among those who worked in that capacity exhaust steam leaving the reciprocating engines was fed into the turbine which was situated aft from there it passed into a surface condenser to increase the efficiency of the turbine and so that the steam could be condensed back into water and reused the engines were attached directly to long shafts which drove the propellers there were three one for each engine the outer or wing propellers were the largest each carrying three blades of manganesebronze alloy with a total diameter of  feet  m the middle propeller was slightly smaller at  feet  m in diameter and could be stopped but not reversed titanics electrical plant was capable of producing more power than an average city power station of the time immediately aft of the turbine engine were four  kw steamdriven electric generators used to provide electrical power to the ship plus two  kw auxiliary generators for emergency use their location in the stern of the ship meant they remained operational until the last few minutes before the ship sank titanic lacked a searchlight in accordance with the ban on the use of searchlights in the merchant navy technology compartments and funnels the interiors of the olympicclass ships were subdivided into  primary compartments divided by  bulkheads that extended above the waterline the eleven vertically closing watertight doors on the orlop deck could be closed automatically via a switch on the bridge by a lever next to the door itself or by an automatic buoyancy mechanism that would activate in the event water reached six feet high in the compartment there were also several other horizontally closing watertight doors along scotland road and various crew and third class passenger spaces on the g f and e decks these doors required a small key to be placed into a slot on the deck above once the key was turned the watertight door would close the ships exposed decking was made of pine and teak while interior ceilings were covered in painted granulated cork to combat condensation standing above the decks were four funnels each painted in the white star buff with black tops only three were functionalthe aftmost one was a dummy installed for aesthetic purposes and used for providing ventilation to the kitchen as well as for the first and second class smoking rooms two masts each  ft  m high supported derricks for working cargo rudder and steering engines titanics rudder was  feet  inches  m high and  feet  inches  m long weighing over  tonnes its size was such that it required steering engines to move it two steampowered steering engines were installed though only one was used at any given time with the other one kept in reserve they were connected to the short tiller through stiff springs to isolate the steering engines from any shocks in heavy seas or during fast changes of direction as a last resort the tiller could be moved by ropes connected to two steam capstans the capstans were also used to raise and lower the ships five anchors one port one starboard one in the centreline and two kedging anchors water ventilation and heating the ship was equipped with waterworks capable of heating and pumping water to all parts of the vessel via a complex network of pipes and valves the main water supply was taken aboard while titanic was in port but in an emergency the ship could also distil fresh water from seawater however this was not a straightforward process as the distillation plant could quickly become clogged by salt deposits a network of insulated ducts conveyed warm air around the ship with electric fans and firstclass cabins were fitted with additional electric heaters the sirocco fan a centrifugal fan was used after a deal with hw took place with davidson and co sirocco works radio communications titanics radiotelegraph equipment then known as wireless telegraphy was leased to the white star line by the marconi international marine communication company which also supplied two of its employees jack phillips and harold bride as operators the service maintained a hour schedule primarily sending and receiving passenger telegrams marconigrams but also handling navigation messages including weather reports and ice warnings the radio room was located on the boat deck in the officers quarters a soundproofed silent room next to the operating room housed loud equipment including the transmitter and a motorgenerator used for producing alternating currents the operators living quarters were adjacent to the working office the ship was equipped with a state of the art kilowatt rotary sparkgap transmitter with the wireless telegraph call sign mgy and communication was in morse code this transmitter was one of the first marconi installations to use a rotary sparkgap which gave titanic a distinctive musical tone that could be readily distinguished from other signals the transmitter was one of the most powerful in the world and guaranteed to broadcast over a radius of  miles  nmi  km an elevated tantenna that spanned the length of the ship was used for transmitting and receiving the normal operating frequency was  khz  m wavelength however the equipment could also operate on the short wavelength of  khz  m wavelength that was employed by smaller vessels with shorter antennas passenger facilities the passenger facilities aboard titanic aimed to meet the highest standards of luxury according to titanics general arrangement plans the ship could accommodate  first class passengers  in second class and  in third class for a total passenger capacity of  in addition titanics capacity for crew members exceeded  as most documents of the original configuration have stated that the full carrying capacity for passengers and crew was approximately  the ships interior design was a departure from that of other passenger liners which had typically been decorated in the style of a manor house or an english country house titanic was laid out in a much lighter style similar to that of contemporary highclass hotelsthe ritz hotel was a reference pointwith first class cabins finished in the empire style a variety of other decorative styles ranging from the renaissance to louis xv were used to decorate cabins and public rooms in first and second class areas of the ship the aim was to convey an impression that the passengers were in a floating hotel rather than a ship as one passenger recalled on entering the ships interior a passenger would at once lose the feeling that we are on board ship and seem instead to be entering the hall of some great house on shore cabins in first class also contained buttons that when pressed would signal for a steward to come to the cabin among the more novel features available to firstclass passengers was a  ft  m deep saltwater swimming pool a gymnasium a squash court and a victorianstyle turkish bath which comprised hot room warm temperate room coolingroom and two shampooing massage rooms complementing the turkish bath and within the same area was a steam room and an electric bath firstclass common rooms were impressive in scope and lavishly decorated they included a lounge in the style of the palace of versailles an enormous reception room a mens smoking room and a reading and writing room there was an a la carte restaurant in the style of the ritz hotel which was run as a concession by the famous italian restaurateur gaspare gatti a cafe parisien decorated in the style of a french pavement cafe complete with ivycovered trellises and wicker furniture was run as an annex to the restaurant for an extra cost firstclass passengers could enjoy the finest french haute cuisine in the most luxurious of surroundings there was also a verandah cafe where tea and light refreshments were served that offered grand views of the ocean at  ft  m long by  ft  m wide the dining saloon on d deck designed by charles fitzroy doll was the largest room afloat and could seat almost  passengers at a time third class commonly referred to as steerage accommodations aboard titanic were not as luxurious as first or second class but were better than on many other ships of the time where third class accommodations consisted of little more than open dormitories in which hundreds of people were confined often without adequate food or toilet facilities the white star line had long since broken that mould as seen aboard titanic all white star line passenger ships divided their third class accommodations into two sections always at opposite ends of the vessel from one another the established arrangement was that single men were quartered in the forward areas while single women married couples and families were quartered aft in addition while other ships provided only open berth sleeping arrangements white star line vessels provided their thirdclass passengers with private small but comfortable cabins capable of accommodating two four six eight and ten passengers third class accommodations also included their own dining rooms as well as public gathering areas including adequate open deck space this was supplemented by the addition of a smoking room for men and a general room on c deck which women could use for reading and writing leisure facilities were provided for all three classes to pass the time as well as making use of the indoor amenities such as the library smoking rooms and gymnasium it was also customary for passengers to socialise on the open deck promenading or relaxing in hired deck chairs or wooden benches a passenger list was published before the sailing to inform the public which members of the great and good were on board and it was not uncommon for ambitious mothers to use the list to identify rich bachelors to whom they could introduce their marriageable daughters during the voyage one of titanics most distinctive features was the first class staircase known as the grand staircase or grand stairway built of solid english oak with a sweeping curve the staircase descended through seven decks of the ship between the boat deck to e deck before terminating in a simplified single flight on f deck it was capped with a dome of wrought iron and glass that admitted natural light to the stairwell each landing off the staircase gave access to ornate entrance halls panelled in the william  mary style and lit by ormolu and crystal light fixtures at the uppermost landing was a large carved wooden panel containing a clock with figures of honour and glory crowning time flanking the clock face the grand staircase was destroyed during the sinking and is now just a void in the ship which modern explorers have used to access the lower decks during the filming of james camerons titanic in  his replica of the grand staircase was ripped from its foundations by the force of the inrushing water on the set it has been suggested that during the real event the entire grand staircase was ejected upwards through the dome mail and cargo although titanic was primarily a passenger liner the ship also carried a substantial amount of cargo under the designation of royal mail ship rms titanic carried mail under contract with the royal mail and also for the united states post office department for the storage of letters parcels and specie bullion coins and other valuables  cubic feet  m of space was allocated the sea post office on g deck was manned by five postal clerks three americans and two britons who worked  hours a day seven days a week sorting up to  items daily the ships passengers brought with them a huge amount of baggage another  cubic feet  m was taken up by first and secondclass baggage in addition there was a considerable quantity of regular cargo ranging from furniture to foodstuffs and a  renault type ce coupe de ville motor car despite later myths the cargo on titanics maiden voyage was fairly mundane there were no large quantities of gold bars exotic minerals or diamonds the socalled unlucky mummy being on board is also false one of the more famous items lost in the shipwreck a jewelled copy of the rubaiyat of omar khayyam was valued at   today according to the claims for compensation filed with commissioner gilchrist following the conclusion of the senate inquiry the single most highly valued item of luggage or cargo was a large neoclassical oil painting entitled la circassienne au bain by french artist merryjoseph blondel the paintings owner firstclass passenger mauritz hakan bjornstromsteffansson filed a claim for  equivalent to  million in  in compensation for the loss of the artwork other intriguing items in the manifest included twelve cases of ostrich feathers seventysix cases of dragons blood resin and sixteen cases of calabashes titanic was equipped with eight electric cranes four electric winches and three steam winches to lift cargo and baggage in and out of the holds it is estimated that the ship used some  tonnes of coal whilst in southampton simply generating steam to operate the cargo winches and provide heat and light lifeboats like olympic titanic carried a total of  lifeboats  standard wooden harland and wolff lifeboats with a capacity of  people each and four engelhardt collapsible wooden bottom collapsible canvas sides lifeboats identified as a to d with a capacity of  people each in addition titanic had two emergency cutters with a capacity of  people each olympic carried at least two collapsible boats on either side of the number one funnel all of the lifeboats were stowed securely on the boat deck and except for collapsible lifeboats a and b connected to davits by ropes those on the starboard side were oddnumbered  from bow to stern while those on the port side were evennumbered  from bow to stern both cutters were kept swung out hanging from the davits ready for immediate use while collapsible lifeboats c and d were stowed on the boat deck connected to davits immediately inboard of boats  and  respectively a and b were stored on the roof of the officers quarters on either side of number  funnel there were no davits to lower them and their weight would make them difficult to launch by hand each boat carried among other things food water blankets and a spare life belt lifeline ropes on the boats sides enabled them to save additional people from the water if necessary titanic had  sets of davits each able to handle three lifeboats as carlisle had hoped this gave titanic the ability to carry up to  wooden lifeboats however the white star line decided that only  wooden lifeboats and four collapsibles would be carried which could accommodate  people only onethird of titanics total capacity at the time the board of trades regulations required british vessels over  tonnes to carry only  lifeboats with a capacity of  occupants therefore the white star line actually provided more lifeboat accommodation than was legally required at the time lifeboats were intended to ferry survivors from a sinking ship to a rescuing shipnot keep afloat the whole population or power them to shore had ss californian responded to titanics distress calls the lifeboats might have been able to ferry all passengers to safety as planned building and preparing the ship construction launch and fittingout the sheer size of the olympic class vessels posed a major engineering challenge for harland and wolff no shipbuilder had ever before attempted to construct vessels this size the ships were constructed on queens island now known as the titanic quarter in belfast harbour harland and wolff had to demolish three existing slipways and build two new ones the largest ever constructed up to that time to accommodate both ships their construction was facilitated by an enormous gantry built by sir william arrol  co a scottish firm responsible for the building of the forth bridge and londons tower bridge the arrol gantry stood  feet  m high was  feet  m wide and  feet  m long and weighed more than  tonnes it accommodated a number of mobile cranes a separate floating crane capable of lifting  tonnes was brought in from germany the construction of olympic and titanic took place virtually in parallel with olympics keel laid down first on  december  and titanics on  march  both ships took about  months to build and followed much the same construction process they were designed essentially as an enormous floating box girder with the keel acting as a backbone and the frames of the hull forming the ribs at the base of the ships a double bottom  feet  inches  m deep supported  frames each between  and  inches  and  cm apart and measuring up to about  feet  m long they terminated at the bridge deck b deck and were covered with steel plates which formed the outer skin of the ships the  hull plates were single pieces of rolled steel plate mostly up to  feet  m wide and  feet  m long and weighing between  and  tonnes their thickness varied from  to  inches  to  cm the plates were laid in a clinkered overlapping fashion from the keel to the bilge above that point they were laid in the in and out fashion where strake plating was applied in bands the in strakes with the gaps covered by the out strakes overlapping on the edges commercial oxyfuel and electric arc welding methods ubiquitous in fabrication today were still in their infancy like most other iron and steel structures of the era the hull was held together with over three million iron and steel rivets which by themselves weighed over  tonnes they were fitted using hydraulic machines or were hammered in by hand in the s material scientists concluded that the steel plate used for the ship was subject to being especially brittle when cold and that this brittleness exacerbated the impact damage and hastened the sinking it is believed that by the standards of the time the steel plates quality was good not faulty but that it was inferior to what would be used for shipbuilding purposes in later decades owing to advances in the metallurgy of steelmaking as for the rivets considerable emphasis has also been placed on their quality and strength two side anchors and a centre anchor were among the last items to be fitted on titanic before it launched the anchors were a challenge to make the centre anchor was the largest ever forged by hand the head weighed nearly  tonnes and the shank another  twenty clydesdale draught horses were needed to haul the centre anchor by wagon from the noah hingley  sons ltd forge shop in netherton near dudley united kingdom to the dudley railway station two miles away it was then shipped by rail to fleetwood in lancashire before boarding a ship to belfast constructing the ships was difficult and dangerous safety precautions were rudimentary at best for the  men who worked at harland and wolff at the time much of the work was carried out without safety equipment like hard hats or hand guards on machinery  injuries were recorded during titanics construction including  severe injuries such as arms severed by machines or legs crushed under falling pieces of steel six people died on the ship during construction and fitting out and another two died in the shipyard workshops and sheds just before the launch a worker was killed when a piece of wood fell on him titanic was launched at  pm on  may  in the presence of lord pirrie j pierpont morgan j bruce ismay and  onlookers twentytwo tonnes of soap and tallow were spread on the slipway to lubricate the ships passage into the river lagan in keeping with the white star lines traditional policy the ship was not formally named or christened with champagne the ship was towed to a fittingout berth where over the course of the next year the engines funnels and superstructure were installed and interior was fitted out although titanic was virtually identical to the classs lead ship olympic a few changes were made to distinguish both ships the most noticeable exterior difference was that titanic and the third vessel in class britannic had a steel screen with sliding windows installed along the forward half of the a deck promenade this was installed as a lastminute change at the personal request of bruce ismay and was intended to provide additional shelter to first class passengers extensive changes were made to b deck on titanic as the promenade space in this deck which had proven unpopular on olympic was converted into additional firstclass cabins including two opulent parlour suites with their own private promenade spaces the a la carte restaurant was also enlarged and the cafe parisien an entirely new feature which did not exist on olympic was added these changes made titanic slightly heavier than olympic and allowed claim to be the largest ship afloat the work took longer than expected due to design changes requested by ismay and a temporary pause in work occasioned by the need to repair olympic which had been in a collision in september  had titanic been finished earlier the ship might well have missed colliding with an iceberg on  february  titanic was pulled into thompson graving dock it was the largest dry dock of the world and had been built with an eye to building ships of the size of the olympic class here titanic would receive its propellers and final red hull coating however on  march  titanic was moved out again to allow olympic in which had lost a propeller blade sea trials titanics sea trials began at  am on tuesday  april  just two days after the fitting out was finished and eight days before departure from southampton on the maiden voyage the trials were delayed for a day due to bad weather but by monday morning it was clear and fair aboard were  stokers greasers and firemen and  members of crew no domestic staff appear to have been aboard representatives of various companies travelled on titanics sea trials thomas andrews and edward wilding of harland and wolff and harold a sanderson of imm bruce ismay and lord pirrie were too ill to attend jack phillips and harold bride served as radio operators and performed finetuning of the marconi equipment francis carruthers a surveyor from the board of trade was also present to see that everything worked and that the ship was fit to carry passengers the sea trials consisted of a number of tests of handling characteristics carried out first in belfast lough and then in the open waters of the irish sea over the course of about  hours titanic was driven at different speeds turning ability was tested and a crash stop was performed in which the engines were reversed full ahead to full astern bringing the ship to a stop in  yd  m or  minutes and  seconds titanic covered a distance of about  nautical miles  mi  km averaging  knots  mph  kmh and reaching a maximum speed of just under  knots  mph  kmh on returning to belfast at about  pm the surveyor signed an agreement and account of voyages and crew valid for  months which declared the ship seaworthy an hour later titanic departed belfast to head to southampton a voyage of about  nautical miles  mi  km after a journey lasting about  hours titanic arrived about midnight on  april and was towed to the ports berth  ready for the arrival of passengers and the remainder of the crew maiden voyage both olympic and titanic registered liverpool as their home port the offices of the white star line as well as cunard were in liverpool and up until the introduction of the olympic most british ocean liners for both cunard and white star such as lusitania and mauretania sailed from liverpool followed by a port of call in queenstown ireland since the companys founding in  a vast majority of their operations had taken place from liverpool however in  white star line established another service from southampton on englands south coast which became known as white stars express service southampton had many advantages over liverpool the first being its proximity to london in addition southampton being on the south coast allowed ships to easily cross the english channel and make a port of call on the northern coast of france usually at cherbourg this allowed british ships to pick up clientele from continental europe before recrossing the channel and picking up passengers at queenstown the southamptoncherbourgnew york run would become so popular that most british ocean liners began using the port after world war i out of respect for liverpool ships continued to be registered there until the early s queen elizabeth  was one of the first ships registered in southampton when introduced into service by cunard in  titanics maiden voyage was intended to be the first of many transatlantic crossings between southampton and new york via cherbourg and queenstown on westbound runs returning via plymouth in england while eastbound the entire schedule of voyages through to december  still exists when the route was established four ships were assigned to the service in addition to teutonic and majestic rms oceanic and the brand new rms adriatic sailed the route when the olympic entered service in june  the ship replaced teutonic which after completing a last run on the service in late april was transferred to the dominion lines canadian service the following august adriatic was transferred to white star lines main liverpoolnew york service and in november majestic was withdrawn from service pending the arrival of titanic in the coming months and was mothballed as a reserve ship white star lines initial plans for olympic and titanic on the southampton run followed the same routine as their predecessors had done before them each would sail once every three weeks from southampton and new york usually leaving at noon each wednesday from southampton and each saturday from new york thus enabling the white star line to offer weekly sailings in each direction special trains were scheduled from london and paris to convey passengers to southampton and cherbourg respectively the deepwater dock at southampton then known as the white star dock had been specially constructed to accommodate the new olympicclass liners and had opened in  crew titanic had about  crew members on board for the maiden voyage like other vessels of the time titanic did not have a permanent crew and the vast majority of crew members were casual workers who only came aboard the ship a few hours before sailing from southampton the process of signing up recruits began on  march and some were sent to belfast where they served as a skeleton crew on titanics sea trials and passage to england in early april captain edward john smith the most senior of the white star lines captains was transferred from olympic to take command of titanic henry tingle wilde also came across from olympic to take the post of chief mate titanics previously designated chief mate and first officer william mcmaster murdoch and charles lightoller were downgraded to the ranks of first and second officer respectively and the original second officer david blair was dropped altogether the third officer herbert pitman was the only deck officer not a member of the royal naval reserve pitman was the secondtolast surviving officer titanics crew were divided into three principal departments deck with  crew engine with  and victualling with  the vast majority of the crew were thus not seamen but were either engineers firemen or stokers responsible for looking after the engines or stewards and galley staff responsible for the passengers of these over  were male just  of the crew were female mainly stewardesses the rest represented a variety of professionsbakers chefs butchers fishmongers dishwashers stewards gymnasium instructors laundrymen waiters bedmakers cleaners and even a printer who produced a daily newspaper for passengers called the atlantic daily bulletin with the latest news received by the ships wireless operators most of the crew signed on in southampton on  april in all  of the crew came from there and  were natives of the town a few specialist staff were selfemployed or subcontractors including five postal clerks who worked for the royal mail and the united states post office department the staff of the first class a la carte restaurant and the cafe parisien the radio operators who were employed by marconi and the eight musicians who were employed by an agency and travelled as secondclass passengers crew pay varied greatly from captain smiths  a month equivalent to  today to the  s  today that stewardesses earned the lowerpaid victualling staff could however supplement their wages substantially through tips from passengers passengers titanics passengers numbered approximately  people  in first class  in second class and  in third class of these   were male and   female there were  children aboard the largest number of whom were in third class the ship was considerably undercapacity for the maiden voyage and could have accommodated  passengers first class  second class and  third class usually a highprestige vessel like titanic could expect to be fully booked on a maiden voyage however a national coal strike in the uk had caused considerable disruption to shipping schedules in the spring of  causing many crossings to be cancelled many wouldbe passengers chose to postpone their travel plans until the strike was over the strike had finished a few days before titanic sailed however that was too late to have much of an effect titanic was able to sail on the scheduled date only because coal was transferred from other vessels which were tied up at southampton such as ss city of new york and rms oceanic as well as coal that olympic had brought back from a previous voyage to new york which had been stored at the white star dock some of the most prominent people of the day booked a passage aboard titanic travelling in first class among them with those who perished marked with a dagger were the american millionaire john jacob astor iv and his wife madeleine force astor with john jacob astor vi

voyage but cancelled at the last minute also aboard the ship were the white star lines managing director j bruce ismay and titanics designer thomas andrews who was on board to observe any problems and assess the general performance of the new ship the exact number of people aboard is not known as not all of those who had booked tickets made it to the ship about  people cancelled for various reasons and not all of those who boarded stayed aboard for the entire journey fares varied depending on class and season third class fares from london southampton or queenstown cost  s equivalent to  today while the cheapest first class fares cost   today the most expensive first class suites were to have cost up to  in high season  today collecting passengers titanics maiden voyage began on wednesday  april  following the embarkation of the crew the passengers began arriving at  am when the london and south western railways boat train from london waterloo station reached southampton terminus railway station on the quayside alongside titanics berth the large number of third class passengers meant they were the first to board with first and second class passengers following up to an hour before departure stewards showed them to their cabins and first class passengers were personally greeted by captain smith third class passengers were inspected for ailments and physical impairments that might lead to their being refused entry to the united states  a prospect the white star line wished to avoid as it would have to carry anyone who failed the examination back across the atlantic in all  passengers boarded titanic at southampton   first class  second class and  third class additional passengers were to be picked up at cherbourg and queenstown the maiden voyage began at noon as scheduled an accident was narrowly averted only a few minutes later as titanic passed the moored liners ss city of new york of the american line and oceanic of the white star line the latter of which would have been a running mate on the service from southampton the ships displacement caused both of the smaller ships to be lifted by a bulge of water and dropped into a trough new yorks mooring cables could not take the sudden strain and snapped swinging around sternfirst towards titanic a nearby tugboat vulcan came to the rescue by taking new york under tow and captain smith ordered titanics engines to be put full astern the two ships avoided a collision by a distance of about  feet  m the incident delayed titanics departure for about an hour while the drifting new york was brought under control after making it safely through the complex tides and channels of southampton water and the solent titanic disembarked the southampton pilot at the nab lightship and headed out into the english channel the ship headed for the french port of cherbourg a journey of  nautical miles  mi  km the weather was windy very fine but cold and overcast because cherbourg lacked docking facilities for a ship the size of titanic tenders had to be used to transfer passengers from shore to ship the white star line operated two tenders at cherbourg ss traffic and ss nomadic nomadic is the only surviving white star line ship both had been designed specifically as tenders for the olympicclass liners and launched shortly after titanic four hours after leaving southampton titanic arrived at cherbourg and was met by the tenders where  additional passengers were taken aboard  first class  second class and  third class twentyfour passengers had booked a crosschannel passage only and were left aboard the tenders to be conveyed to shore a process completed within  minutes at  pm titanic weighed anchor and left for queenstown with the weather remaining cold and windy at  am on thursday  april titanic arrived at cork harbour on the south coast of ireland it was a partly cloudy but relatively warm day with a brisk wind again the dock facilities were not suitable for a ship of titanics size and the tenders america and ireland were used to bring passengers aboard in all  passengers boarded titanic at queenstown  three first class seven second class and  third class in addition to the  crosschannel passengers who had disembarked at cherbourg another seven passengers had booked an overnight passage from southampton to queenstown among the seven was francis browne a jesuit trainee who was a keen photographer and took many photographs aboard titanic including one of the last known photographs of the ship the very last one was taken by another crosschannel passenger kate odell a decidedly unofficial departure was that of a crew member stoker john coffey a queenstown native who sneaked off the ship by hiding under mail bags being transported to shore titanic weighed anchor for the last time at  pm and departed on the westward journey across the atlantic atlantic crossing titanic was planned to arrive at new york pier  on the morning of  april after leaving queenstown titanic followed the irish coast as far as fastnet rock a distance of some  nautical miles  mi  km from there the voyage of  nautical miles  mi  km along a great circle route across the north atlantic reached a spot in the ocean known as the corner southeast of newfoundland where westbound steamers carried out a change of course titanic sailed only a few hours past the corner on a rhumb line leg of  nautical miles  mi  km to nantucket shoals light when making fatal contact with an iceberg the final leg of the journey would have been  nautical miles  mi  km to ambrose light and finally to new york harbor from  april to local apparent noon the next day titanic covered  nautical miles  mi  km the following day  nautical miles  mi  km and by noon on the final day of the voyage  nautical miles  mi  km from then until the time of sinking the ship travelled another  nautical miles  mi  km averaging about  knots  mph  kmh the weather cleared as titanic left ireland under cloudy skies with a headwind temperatures remained fairly mild on saturday  april but the following day titanic crossed a cold weather front with strong winds and waves of up to  feet  m these died down as the day progressed until by the evening of sunday  april it became clear calm and very cold the first three days of the voyage from queenstown had passed without apparent incident a fire had begun in titanics forward most coal bunker that supplied coal to boiler rooms six and five approximately  days prior to the ships departure and continued to burn for several days into its voyage but passengers were unaware of this situation fires occurred frequently on board steamships at the time due to spontaneous combustion of the coal the fires had to be extinguished with fire hoses by moving the coal on top to another bunker and by removing the burning coal and feeding it into the furnace the fire was finally extinguished on  april there has been some speculation and discussion as to whether this fire and attempts to extinguish it may have made the ship more vulnerable to sinking titanic received a series of warnings from other ships of drifting ice in the area of the grand banks of newfoundland but captain smith ignored them one of the ships to warn titanic was the atlantic lines mesaba nevertheless titanic continued to steam at full speed which was standard practice at the time although not trying to set a speed record timekeeping was a priority and under prevailing maritime practices ships were often operated at close to full speed ice warnings were seen as advisories and reliance was placed upon lookouts and the watch on the bridge it was generally believed that ice posed little danger to large vessels close calls with ice were not uncommon and even headon collisions had not been disastrous in  ss kronprinz wilhelm a german liner had rammed an iceberg but still completed the voyage and captain smith said in  that he could not imagine any condition which would cause a ship to founder modern shipbuilding has gone beyond that sinking at  pm ships time on  april lookout frederick fleet spotted an iceberg immediately ahead of titanic and alerted the bridge first officer william murdoch ordered the ship to be steered around the iceberg and the engines to be reversed but it was too late the starboard side of titanic struck the iceberg creating a series of holes below the waterline the hull was not punctured but rather dented such that the steel plates of the hull buckled and separated allowing water to rush in five of the sixteen watertight compartments were heavily breached and a sixth was slightly compromised it soon became clear that titanic would sink as the ship could not remain afloat with more than four compartments flooded titanic began sinking bowfirst with water spilling from compartment to compartment over the top of each watertight bulkhead as the ships angle in the water became steeper those aboard titanic were illprepared for such an emergency in accordance with accepted practices of the time as ships were seen as largely unsinkable and lifeboats were intended to transfer passengers to nearby rescue vessels titanic only had enough lifeboats to carry about half of those on board if the ship had carried the full complement of about  passengers and crew only about a third could have been accommodated in the lifeboats the crew had not been trained adequately in carrying out an evacuation the officers did not know how many they could safely put aboard the lifeboats and launched many of them barely halffull thirdclass passengers were largely left to fend for themselves causing many of them to become trapped below decks as the ship filled with water the women and children first protocol was generally followed when loading the lifeboats and most of the male passengers and crew were left aboard women and children survived at rates of about  per cent and  per cent while only  per cent of men survived between  and  am a little over two and a half hours after titanic struck the iceberg the rate of sinking suddenly increased as the boat deck dipped underwater and the sea poured in through open hatches and grates following which the electrical power supply on board stopped after the circuit breakers tripped and the lights flickered and went out as the ships unsupported stern rose out of the water exposing the propellers the ship broke in two main pieces between the second and third funnels due to the immense forces on the keel with the bow underwater and air trapped in the stern the stern remained afloat and buoyant for a few minutes longer rising to a nearly vertical angle with hundreds of people still clinging to it before foundering at  am it was believed that titanic sank in one piece but the  discovery of the wreck revealed that the ship had broken in two all remaining passengers and crew were immersed in water at a temperature of  c  f only five who were in the water were helped into the lifeboats though the lifeboats had room for almost  more people distress signals were sent by wireless rockets and lamp but none of the ships that responded were near enough to reach titanic before sinking a radio operator on board ss birma for instance estimated that it would be  am before the liner could arrive at the scene meanwhile ss californian which was the last to have been in contact before the collision saw titanics flares but failed to assist around  am rms carpathia arrived on the scene in response to titanics earlier distress calls when the ship sank the lifeboats that had been lowered were only filled up to an average of  the number of survivors have been variously reported as between  and  while estimates both official and otherwise vary it is generally accepted that approximately  persons died in the disaster aftermath of sinking immediate aftermath rms carpathia took three days to reach new york after leaving the scene of the disaster with a journey slowed by pack ice fog thunderstorms and rough seas carpathia was however able to pass news to the outside world by wireless about what had happened the initial reports were confusing leading the american press to report erroneously on  april that titanic was being towed to port by ss virginian late on the night of  april white star reported a message was received saying titanic had sunk but all passengers and crew had been transferred to another vessel later that day confirmation came through that titanic had been lost and that most of the passengers and crew had died the news attracted crowds of people to the white star lines offices in london new york montreal southampton liverpool and belfast it hit hardest in southampton whose people suffered the greatest losses from the sinking four out of every five crew members came from this town carpathia docked at  pm on  april at new yorks pier  and was greeted by some  people waiting at the quayside in heavy rain immediate relief in the form of clothing and transportation to shelters was provided by the womens relief committee the travelers aid society of new york and the council of jewish women among other organisations many of titanics surviving passengers did not linger in new york but headed onwards immediately to relatives homes some of the wealthier survivors chartered private trains to take them home and the pennsylvania railroad laid on a special train free of charge to take survivors to philadelphia titanics  surviving crew members were taken to the red star lines steamer ss lapland where they were accommodated in passenger cabins carpathia was hurriedly restocked with food and provisions before resuming the journey to fiume austriahungary the crew were given a bonus of a months wages by cunard as a reward for their actions and some of titanics passengers joined to give them an additional bonus of nearly   today divided among the crew members the ships arrival in new york led to a frenzy of press interest with newspapers competing to be the first to report the survivors stories some reporters bribed their way aboard the pilot boat new york which guided carpathia into harbour and one even managed to get onto carpathia before docking crowds gathered outside newspaper offices to see the latest reports being posted in the windows or on billboards it took another four days for a complete list of casualties to be compiled and released adding to the agony of relatives waiting for news of those who had been aboard titanic insurance aid for survivors and lawsuits in january  the hulls and equipment of titanic and olympic had been insured through lloyds of london and london marine insurance the total coverage was  million  million today per ship the policy was to be free from all average under  meaning that the insurers would only pay for damage in excess of that sum the premium negotiated by brokers willis faber  company now willis group was  s  p per  or   today for the term of one year lloyds paid the white star line the full sum owed to them within  days many charities were set up to help the survivors and their families many of whom lost their sole wage earner or in the case of many thirdclass survivors everything they owned in new york city for example a joint committee of the american red cross and charity organization society formed to disburse financial aid to survivors and dependents of those who died on  april opera stars enrico caruso and mary garden and members of the metropolitan opera raised   today in benefits for victims of the disaster by giving special concerts in which versions of autumn and nearer my god to thee were part of the programme in britain relief funds were organised for the families of titanics lost crew members raising nearly   million today one such fund was still in operation as late as the s in the united states and britain more than  survivors combined to sue the white star line for damages connected to loss of life and baggage the claims totalled  equivalent to  in  which was far in excess of what white star argued it was responsible for as a limited liability company under american law because the bulk of the litigants were in the united states white star petitioned the united states supreme court in  which ruled in its favour that it qualified as an llc and found that the causes of the ships sinking were largely unforeseeable rather than due to negligence this sharply limited the scope of damages survivors and family members were entitled to prompting them to reduce their claims to some  million  million today white star only settled for   million today about  of the original total sought by survivors the settlement was agreed to by  of the claimants in december  with   million today set aside for the american claimants   million today for the british and   million today to go towards interest and legal expenses investigations into the disaster even before the survivors arrived in new york investigations were being planned to discover what had happened and what could be done to prevent a recurrence inquiries were held in both the united states and the united kingdom the former more robustly critical of traditions and practices and scathing of the failures involved and the latter broadly more technical and expertorientated the us senates inquiry into the disaster was initiated on  april a day after carpathia arrived in new york the chairman senator william alden smith wanted to gather accounts from passengers and crew while the events were still fresh in their minds smith also needed to subpoena all surviving british passengers and crew while they were still on american soil which prevented them from returning to the uk before the american inquiry was completed on  may the british press condemned smith as an opportunist insensitively forcing an inquiry as a means of gaining political prestige and seizing his moment to stand on the world stage smith however already had a reputation as a campaigner for safety on us railroads and wanted to investigate any possible malpractices by railroad tycoon j p morgan titanics ultimate owner the british board of trades inquiry into the disaster was headed by lord mersey and took place between  may and  july being run by the board of trade who had previously approved the ship it was seen by some as having little interest in its own or white stars conduct being found negligent each inquiry took testimony from both passengers and crew of titanic crew members of leyland lines californian captain arthur rostron of carpathia and other experts the british inquiry also took far greater expert testimony making it the longest and most detailed court of inquiry in british history up to that time the two inquiries reached broadly similar conclusions the regulations on the number of lifeboats that ships had to carry were out of date and inadequate captain smith had failed to take proper heed of ice warnings the lifeboats had not been properly filled or crewed and the collision was the direct result of steaming into a dangerous area at too high a speed neither inquirys findings listed negligence by imm or the white star line as a factor the american inquiry concluded that since those involved had followed standard practice the disaster was an act of god the british inquiry concluded that smith had followed longstanding practice that had not previously been shown to be unsafe noting that british ships alone had carried  million passengers over the previous decade with the loss of just  lives and concluded that smith had done only that which other skilled men would have done in the same position lord mersey did however find fault with the extremely high speed twentytwo knots which was maintained following numerous ice warnings noting that what was a mistake in the case of the titanic would without doubt be negligence in any similar case in the future the recommendations included strong suggestions for major changes in maritime regulations to implement new safety measures such as ensuring that more lifeboats were provided that lifeboat drills were properly carried out and that wireless equipment on passenger ships was manned around the clock an international ice patrol was set up to monitor the presence of icebergs in the north atlantic and maritime safety regulations were harmonised internationally through the international convention for the safety of life at sea both measures are still in force today on  june  guglielmo marconi gave evidence to the court of inquiry regarding the telegraphy its final report recommended that all liners carry the system and that sufficient operators maintain a constant service the way the titanic sank brought to light serious design issues with the olympicclass as a result the olympic went through a major refit and design changes for the construction of the britannic in august  the liner corsican struck an iceberg in the atlantic severely damaging the bow however because the weather was hazy at the time speed had been reduced to dead slow which limited further damage while the lifeboats had been deployed they were not boarded role of ss californian one of the most controversial issues examined by the inquiries was the role played by ss californian which had been only a few miles from titanic but had not picked up distress calls or responded to signal rockets californian had stopped for the night because of icy conditions and its wireless operator cyril furmstone evans informed titanic by radio hey old man were stopped for the night and surrounded by ice he was told to stop transmitting by titanics senior wireless operator jack phillips who was busy clearing a backlog of messages with cape race whose signals were faint testimony before the british inquiry revealed that at  pm californian observed the lights of a ship to the south it was later agreed between captain stanley lord and third officer cv groves who had relieved lord of duty at  pm that this was a passenger liner at  pm the officer watched that ships lights flash out as if shutting down or turning sharply and noted that the port light was visible morse light signals to the ship upon lords order were made between  pm and  am but were not acknowledged if titanic was as far from the californian as lord claimed morse signals would not have been visible a reasonable and prudent course of action would have been to awaken the wireless operator and to instruct him to attempt to contact titanic by that method had lord done so it is possible he could have reached titanic in time to save additional lives captain lord had gone to the chart room at  pm second officer herbert stone now on duty notified lord at  am that the ship had fired five rockets lord wanted to know if they were company signals that is coloured flares used for identification stone said that he did not know and that the rockets were all white captain lord instructed the crew to continue to signal the other vessel with the morse lamp and went back to sleep three more rockets were observed at  am and stone noted that the ship looked strange in the water as if the ship were listing at  am lord was notified that the ship could no longer be seen lord asked again if the lights had had any colours in them and he was informed that they were all white californian eventually responded at around  am chief officer george stewart awakened wireless operator cyril furmstone evans informed him that rockets had been seen during the night and asked that he try to communicate with any ship he got news of titanics loss captain lord was notified and the ship set out to render assistance arriving well after carpathia had already picked up all the survivors the inquiries found that the ship seen by californian was in fact titanic and that it would have been possible for californian to aid rescue therefore captain lord had acted improperly in failing to do so survivors and victims the number of casualties of the sinking is unclear because of a number of factors these include confusion over the passenger list which included some names of people who cancelled their trip at the last minute and the fact that several passengers travelled under aliases for various reasons and were therefore doublecounted on the casualty lists the death toll has been put at between  and  people the tables below use figures from the british board of trade report on the disaster while the use of the marconi wireless system did not achieve the result of bringing a rescue ship to titanic before it sank the use of wireless did bring carpathia in time to rescue some of the survivors who otherwise would have perished due to exposure the water temperature was well below normal in the area where titanic sank it also contributed to the rapid death of many passengers during the sinking water temperature readings taken around the time of the accident were reported to be  c  f typical water temperatures were normally around  c  f during midapril the coldness of the water was a critical factor often causing death within minutes for many of those in the water fewer than a third of those aboard titanic survived the disaster some survivors died shortly afterwards injuries and the effects of exposure caused the deaths of several of those brought aboard carpathia the figures show stark differences in the survival rates of the different classes aboard titanic although only  of firstclass women were lost  of those in thirdclass died similarly five of six firstclass and all secondclass children survived but  of the  in thirdclass perished the differences by gender were even bigger nearly all female crew members first and secondclass passengers were saved men from the first class died at a higher rate than women from the third class in total  of the children survived  of the men and  of the women thomas andrews the chief naval architect of the shipyard died in the disaster the last living survivor millvina dean from england who at only nine weeks old was the youngest passenger on board died aged  on  may  two special survivors were the stewardess violet jessop and the stoker arthur john priest who survived the sinkings of both titanic and hmhs britannic and were aboard rms olympic when the ship was rammed in  aforementioned tennis player richard n williams survived as a first class male passenger by swimming to a life boat he almost had his legs amputated from frostbite but managed to keep them and continue his sports career his father who was beside him in the water was on the other hand killed by a funnel retrieval and burial of the dead once the massive loss of life became known white star line chartered the cable ship cs mackaybennett from halifax nova scotia canada to retrieve bodies three other canadian ships followed in the search the cable ship cs minia lighthouse supply ship montmagny and sealing vessel algerine each ship left with embalming supplies undertakers and clergy of the  victims who were eventually recovered  were retrieved by the canadian ships and five more by passing north atlantic steamships the first ship to reach the site of the sinking the cs mackaybennett found so many bodies that the embalming supplies aboard were quickly exhausted health regulations required that only embalmed bodies could be returned to port captain larnder of the mackaybennett and undertakers aboard decided to preserve only the bodies of firstclass passengers justifying their decision by the need to visually identify wealthy men to resolve any disputes over large estates as a result many thirdclass passengers and crew were buried at sea larnder identified many of those buried at sea as crew members by their clothing and stated that as a mariner he himself would be content to be buried at sea bodies of passengers of the titanic were numbered as they were brought aboard physical characteristics clothing identifying marks and personal effects were all documented personal effects were stored separately labelled with the same body number and valuables were locked up by the purser without enough material or space to handle bodies and their belongings the crew had to triage bodies recovered were preserved for transport to halifax the closest city to the sinking with direct rail and steamship connections the halifax registrar of vital statistics john henry barnstead developed a detailed system to identify bodies and safeguard personal possessions relatives from across north america came to identify and claim bodies a large temporary morgue was set up in the curling rink of the mayflower curling club and undertakers were called in from all across eastern canada to assist some bodies were shipped to be buried in their home towns across north america and europe about twothirds of the bodies were identified unidentified victims were buried with simple numbers based on the order in which their bodies were discovered the majority of recovered victims  bodies were buried in three halifax cemeteries the largest being fairview lawn cemetery  bodies followed by the nearby mount olivet cemetery  bodies and the jewish baron de hirsch cemetery  bodies in midmay  rms oceanic recovered three bodies over  miles  km from the site of the sinking who were among the original occupants of collapsible a when fifth officer harold lowe and six crewmen returned to the wreck site sometime after the sinking in a lifeboat to pick up survivors they rescued a dozen men and one woman from collapsible a but left the dead bodies of three of its occupants after their retrieval from collapsible a by oceanic the bodies were buried at sea the last titanic body recovered was steward james mcgrady body no  found by the chartered newfoundland sealing vessel algerine on  may and buried at fairview lawn cemetery in halifax on  june  bodies of titanic victims were recovered which amounted to one in five of the over  victims some bodies sank with the ship while currents quickly dispersed bodies and wreckage across hundreds of miles making them difficult to recover by june one of the last search ships reported that life jackets supporting bodies were coming apart and releasing bodies to sink wreck titanic was long thought to have sunk in one piece and over the years many schemes were put forward for raising the wreck none came to fruition the fundamental problem was the sheer difficulty of finding and reaching a wreck that lies over  feet  m below the surface where the water pressure is over  pounds per square inch  megapascals about  standard atmospheres a number of expeditions were mounted to find titanic but it was not until  september  that a francoamerican expedition led by jeanlouis michel and robert ballard succeeded the team discovered that titanic had in fact split apart probably near or at the surface before sinking to the seabed the separated bow and stern sections lie about a onethird of a mile  km apart in titanic canyon off the coast of newfoundland they are located  miles  km from the inaccurate coordinates given by titanics radio operators on the night of the ships sinking and approximately  miles  km from halifax and  miles  km from new york both sections struck the seabed at considerable speed causing the bow to crumple and the stern to collapse entirely the bow is by far the more intact section and still contains some surprisingly intact interiors in contrast the stern is completely wrecked its decks have pancaked down on top of each other and much of the hull plating was torn off and lies scattered across the sea floor the much greater level of damage to the stern is probably due to structural damage incurred during the sinking thus weakened the remainder of the stern was flattened by the impact with the sea bed the two sections are surrounded by a debris field measuring approximately  by  miles  km   km it contains hundreds of thousands of items such as pieces of the ship furniture dinnerware and personal items which fell from the ship while sinking or ejected when the bow and stern impacted on the sea floor the debris field was also the last resting place of a number of titanics victims most of the bodies and clothes were consumed by sea creatures and bacteria leaving pairs of shoes and bootswhich have proved to be inedibleas the only sign that bodies once lay there since its initial discovery the wreck of titanic has been revisited on numerous occasions by explorers scientists filmmakers tourists and salvagers who have recovered thousands of items from the debris field for conservation and public display the ships condition has deteriorated significantly over the years particularly from accidental damage by submersibles but mostly because of an accelerating rate of growth of ironeating bacteria on the hull in  it was estimated that within  years the hull and structure of titanic would eventually collapse entirely leaving only the more durable interior fittings of the ship intermingled with a pile of rust on the sea floor many artefacts from titanic have been recovered from the seabed by rms titanic inc which exhibits them in touring exhibitions around the world and in a permanent exhibition at the luxor las vegas hotel and casino in las vegas nevada a number of other museums exhibit artefacts either donated by survivors or retrieved from the floating bodies of victims of the disaster on  april  the day after the th anniversary of the sinking photos were released showing possible human remains resting on the ocean floor the photos taken by robert ballard during an expedition led by noaa in  show a boot and a coat close to titanics stern which experts called compelling evidence that it is the spot where somebody came to rest and that human remains could be buried in the sediment beneath them the wreck of the titanic falls under the scope of the  unesco convention on the protection of the underwater cultural heritage this means that all states party to the convention will prohibit the pillaging commercial exploitation sale and dispersion of the wreck and its artefacts because of the location of the wreck in international waters and the lack of any exclusive jurisdiction over the wreckage area the convention provides a state cooperation system by which states inform each other of any potential activity concerning ancient shipwreck sites like the titanic and cooperate to prevent unscientific or unethical interventions submersible dives in  have found further deterioration of the wreck including loss of the captains bathtub between  july and  august  a twoperson submersible vehicle that was conducting research and filming a documentary crashed into the wreck eyos expeditions executed the dives it reported that the strong currents pushed the submersible into the wreck leaving a red rust stain on the submersibles side the report did not mention if the titanic sustained damage in may  magellan ltd a deepwater seabedmapping company announced that they had created a digital twin of the titanic showing the wreckage in a level of detail that had never been captured before the company created the model from some  d images captured over the course of a sixweek expedition in the summer of  using two submersibles named romeo and juliet they mapped every millimetre of the wreckage as well as the entire threenauticalmile  km debris field creating the model took about eight months on  june  the submersible titan operated by oceangate expeditions imploded in the north atlantic ocean off the coast of newfoundland the submersible was carrying an expedition of tourists to view the wreckage of the titanic on  july  rms titanic inc held their first expedition to the wreck in  years with the objective of examining its status in highresolution photography for future scientific studies likewise with identifying and searching for onsite artefacts the event received coverage from the bbc who interviewed numerous figures involved such as coleader david gallo who said we want to see the wreck with a clarity and precision thats never before been achieved a magnetometer was utilised to produce metal detection  whether visible or not  for the first time in the history of titanic expeditions legacy safety after the disaster recommendations were made by both the british and american boards of inquiry stating that ships should carry enough lifeboats for all aboard mandatory lifeboat drills would be implemented lifeboat inspections would be conducted etc many of these recommendations were incorporated into the international convention for the safety of life at sea passed in  the convention has been updated by periodic amendments with a completely new version adopted in  signatories to the convention followed up with national legislation to implement the new standards for example in britain new rules for life saving appliances were passed by the board of trade on  may  and then applied at a meeting of british steamship companies in liverpool in june  further the united states government passed the radio act of  this act along with the international convention for the safety of life at sea stated that radio communications on passenger ships would be operated  hours a day along with a secondary power supply so as not to miss distress calls also the radio act of  required ships to maintain contact with vessels in their vicinity as well as coastal onshore radio stations in addition it was agreed in the international convention for the safety of life at sea that the firing of red rockets from a ship must be interpreted as a sign of need for help once the radio act of  was passed it was agreed that rockets at sea would be interpreted as distress signals only thus removing any possible misinterpretation from other ships in the same year the board of trade chartered the barque scotia to act as a weather ship in the grand banks of newfoundland keeping a lookout for icebergs a marconi wireless telegraph was installed to enable her to communicate with stations on the coast of labrador and newfoundland finally the disaster led to the formation and international funding of the international ice patrol an agency of the us coast guard that to the
