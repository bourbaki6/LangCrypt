semiotics is the study of signs it is an interdisciplinary field that examines what signs are how they form sign systems and how individuals use them to communicate meaning its main branches are syntactics which addresses formal relations between signs semantics which addresses the relation between signs and their meanings and pragmatics which addresses the relation between signs and their users semiotics is related to linguistics but has a broader scope that includes nonlinguistic signs such as maps and clothing signs are entities that stand for something else like the word cat which stands for a carnivorous mammal they can take many forms such as sounds images written marks and gestures iconic signs operate through similarity for them the sign vehicle resembles the referent such as a portrait of a person indexical signs are based on a direct physical link such as smoke as a sign of fire for symbolic signs the relation between sign vehicle and referent is conventional or arbitrary which applies to most linguistic signs models of signs analyze the basic components of signs ferdinand de saussures dyadic model identifies a perceptible image and a concept as the core elements whereas charles sanders peirces triadic model distinguishes a sign vehicle a referent and an effect in the interpreters mind sign systems are structured networks of interrelated signs such as the english language semioticians study how signs combine to form larger expressions called texts they explore how the message of a text depends on the meanings of the signs composing it and how contextual factors and tropes influence this process they also investigate the codes employed to communicate meaning including conventional codes such as the color code of traffic signals and natural codes such as dna encoding hereditary information semiotics has diverse applications because of the pervasive nature of signs many semioticians study cultural products such as literature art and media investigating both the elements used to express meaning and the subtle ideological messages they convey the psychological activities associated with sign use are another research topic biosemiotics extends the scope of inquiry beyond human communication examining sign processes within and between animals plants and other organisms semioticians typically adjust their research approach to their specific domain without a single methodology adopted by all subfields although the roots of semiotic research lie in antiquity it was not until the late th and early th centuries that semiotics emerged as an independent field of inquiry definitions and related fields semiotics is the study of signs or of how meaning is created and communicated through them also called semiology it examines the nature of signs their organization into signs systems like language and the ways individuals interpret and use them semiotics has widereaching applications because of the pervasive nature of signs affecting how individuals experience phenomena communicate ideas and interact with the world these applications make it an interdisciplinary field originating in philosophy and linguistics and closely related to disciplines like psychology anthropology aesthetics sociology and education sciences because most sciences rely on sign processes in some form semiotics is sometimes characterized as a metadiscipline that provides a general approach for the analysis of signs across domains it is controversial whether semiotics is itself a science since there are no universally accepted theoretical assumptions or methods on which semioticians agree semiotics has also been characterized as a theory a doctrine a movement or a discipline apart from its interdisciplinary applications pure semiotics is typically divided into three branches semantics syntactics and pragmatics studying how signs relate to objects to each other and to sign users respectively semiotic inquiry overlaps in various ways with linguistics and communication theory it shares with linguistics the interest in the analysis of sign systems examining the meanings of words how they are combined to form sentences and how they convey messages in concrete contexts a key difference is that linguistics focuses on language while semiotics also studies nonlinguistic signs such as images gestures traffic signs and animal calls communication theory studies how individuals encode convey and interpret both linguistic and nonlinguistic messages it typically focuses on technical aspects of how messages are transmitted usually between distinct organisms semiotics by contrast concentrates on the meaning of messages and the creation of meaning including the role of noncommunicative signs for example semioticians also study naturally occurring biological signs like disease symptoms and signs based on inanimate relations such as smoke as a sign of fire the term semiotics derives from the greek word  semeiotike originally associated with the study of disease symptoms proposing a new field of inquiry of signs john locke suggested the greek term as its name the first use of the english term semiotics dates to the s semiotics became a distinct field of inquiry following the works of the philosopher charles sanders peirce and the linguist ferdinand de saussure the founders of the discipline signs a sign is an entity that stands for something else for example the word cat is a sign that stands for a small domesticated carnivorous mammal signs direct the attention of interpreters away from themselves and toward the entities they represent they can take many forms such as words images sounds and odours similarly they can refer to many types of entities including physical objects events or places psychological feelings and abstract ideas they help people recognize patterns predict outcomes make plans communicate ideas and understand the world semioticians distinguish different elements of signs the sign vehicle is the physical form of the sign such as sound waves or printed letters on a page whereas the referent is the object it stands for the precise number and nature of these elements is disputed and different models of signs propose distinct analyses the referent of a sign can itself be a sign leading to a chain of signification for instance the expression red rose is a sign for a particular type of flower which can itself act as a sign of love semiosis is the capacity or activity of comprehending and producing signs also characterized as the action of signs it involves the interplay between sign vehicle and referent as organisms interpret meaning within a given context different types of semiosis are distinguished by the type of organisms engaging in the sign activity such as the contrast between anthroposemiosis involving humans zoosemiosis involving other animals and phytosemiosis involving plants meaning sense and reference the meaning of a sign is what is generated in the process of semiosis meaning is typically analyzed into two aspects sense and reference this distinction is also known by the terms connotation and denotation as well as intension and extension the reference of a sign is the object for which it stands for example the reference of the term morning star is the planet venus the sense of a sign is the way it stands for the object or the mode in which the object is presented for instance the terms morning star and evening star have the same reference since they point to the same object however their meanings are not identical since they differ on the level of sense by presenting this object from distinct perspectives various theories of meaning have been proposed to explain its nature and identify the conditions that determine the meanings of signs referential or extensional theories define meaning in terms of reference for example as the signified object or as a contextdependent function that points to objects ideational or mentalist theories interpret the meaning of a sign in relation to the mental states of language users for example as the ideas it evokes pragmatic theories describe meaning based on behavioral responses and use conditions types and sign relations semioticians distinguish various types of signs often based on the sign relation or how the sign vehicle is connected to the referent a type is a general pattern or universal class corresponding to shared features of individual signs types contrast with tokens which are individual instances of a type for example the word banana encompasses six letter tokens b a n a n and a which belong to three distinct types b a and n a historically influential classification of sign types relies on the contrast between conventional and natural signs conventional signs depend on culturally established norms and intentionality to establish the link between sign vehicle and referent for example the meaning of the term tree is fixed by social conventions associated with the english language rather than a natural connection between the term and actual trees natural signs by contrast are based on a substantial link other than conventions for instance the footprint of a bear signifies the presence of a bear as a result of the bears movement rather than a matter of convention in modern semiotics the distinction between natural and conventional signs has been replaced by the threefold classification into icons indices and symbols initially proposed by peirce icons are signs that operate through similarity sign vehicles resemble or imitate the referents to which they are linked they include direct physical similarity such as a lifelike portrait depicting a person but also encompass more abstract resemblance such as metaphors and diagrams icons are also used in animal communication for instance ants of the species pogonomyrmex badius use a smellbased warning signal that resembles the type of danger with a correspondence between intensity and duration of signal and danger indices are signs that operate through a direct physical link typically the referent is the cause of the sign vehicle for example smoke indicates the presence of fire because it is a physical effect produced by the fire itself similarly disease symptoms are signs of the disease causing them and a thermometers gauge reading indicates the temperature responsible other material links besides a direct causeeffect relation are also possible such as a directional signpost physically pointing the path to a nearby campsite symbols are signs that operate through conventionbased associations for them the relation between sign vehicle and referent is arbitrary it arises from social agreements which an individual needs to learn in order to decode the meaning examples are the numeral  the colors on traffic lights and national flags the categories of icon index and symbol are not exclusive and the same sign may belong to more than one for example some road warning signs combine iconic elements like an image of falling rocks to indicate rockslide with symbolic elements such as a red triangle to signal danger various other categories are discussed in the academic literature thomas sebeok expands the iconindexsymbol classification by adding three more categories signals are signs that typically trigger behavioral responses in the receiver symptoms are automatic nonarbitrary signs names are extensional signs that identify one specific individual other categorizations of signs are based on the channel of transmission the intentions of the communicators vagueness ambiguity reliability complexity and type of referent models models of signs seek to identify the essential components of signs many models have been proposed and most introduce a unique terminology for the different components although they often share substantial conceptual overlap a common classification distinguishes between dyadic and triadic models dyadic models assert that signs have essentially two components a sign vehicle and its meaning an influential dyadic model was proposed by saussure who names the components signifier and signified the signifier is a sensible image whereas the signified is a concept or an idea associated with this form for saussure the sign is a relation that connects signifier and signified functioning as a bridge from a sensory form to a concept he understands both signifier and signified as psychological elements that exist in the mind as a result the meaning of signs is limited to the realm of ideas and does not directly concern the external objects to which signs refer focusing on language as a general model of signs saussure argued that the relation between signifier and signified is arbitrary meaning that any sensible image could in principle be paired with any concept he held that individual signs need to be understood in the context of sign systems which organize and regulate the arbitrary connections various interpreters of saussures model such as louis hjelmslev and roman jakobson rejected the purely psychological interpretation of signs for them signifiers are material forms that can be seen or heard not mental images of material forms similarly critics have objected to the idea that the relation between signs and signifiers are always arbitrary pointing to iconic and indexical signs as counterexamples triadic models assert that signs have three components an influential triadic model proposed by peirce argues that the third component is required to account for the individual that interprets signs implying that there is no meaning without interpretation according to peirce a sign is a relation between representamen object and interpretant the representamen is a perceptible entity the object is the referent for which the representamen stands and the interpretant is the effect produced in the mind of the interpreter peirce distinguishes various aspects of these components the immediate object is the object as the sign presents ita mental representation the dynamic object by contrast is the actual entity as it really is which anchors the meaning of the sign the immediate interpretant is the signs potential meaning whereas the dynamic interpretant is the signs actual effect or the understanding it produces the final interpretant is the ideal meaning that would be reached after an exhaustive inquiry peirce emphasizes that semiosis or meaningmaking is a continuously evolving process analyzing peirces model umberto eco talks of an unlimited semiosis in which the interpretation of one sign leads to more signs resulting in an endless chain of signification another triadic model proposed by charles kay ogden and i a richards distinguishes between symbol thought and referent known as the semiotic triangle it asserts that the connection between symbol and referent is not direct but requires the mediation of thought to establish the link sign systems a sign system is a complex of relations governing how signs are formed combined and interpreted such as a specific language signs usually occur in the context of a sign system and some semiotic theories assert that isolated signs have little meaning apart from their systemic relations to other signs sign elements and texts sign systems often rely on basic constituents or sign elements to compose signs for example alphabetic writing systems use letters as sign elements to construct words while morse code uses dots and dashes letters are essential for differentiating word meanings like the contrast between the words cat rat and hat based on their initial letter the basic sign elements usually do not have a meaning of their own unless combined in systematic ways a text is a large sign composed of several smaller signs according to a specific code unlike basic sign elements the units composing a text are themselves meaningful the meaning of a text called its message depends on its components however it is usually not a mere aggregate of their isolated meanings but shaped by their interaction and organization in addition to linguistic texts such as a novel or a mathematical formula there are also nonlinguistic texts such as a diagram a poster or a musical composition consisting of several movements the capacity to create and understand texts known as textuality is also present in some nonhuman animals for example honey bees perform a complex dance combining diverse features to communicate information about their environment to other bees the meaning of a text can depend on and refer to other textsa feature called intertextuality semioticians distinguish several aspects of texts paratext encompasses elements that frame or surround a text such as titles headings acknowledgments footnotes and illustrations architext refers to the general categories to which a text belongs such as its genre style medium and authorship a metatext is a text that comments on another text a hypotext is a text that serves as the basis of another text such as a novel that has a sequel or is parodied in another work in such cases the derivative text that refers to the earlier work is the hypertext structural relations between signs the signs in a sign system are connected through several structural relations like the contrast between syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations syntagmatic relations govern how individual signs or sign elements can be combined to form larger expressions for example sentences are linear arrangements of words and syntagmatic relations govern which words can be combined to produce grammatically correct sentences similarly a dinner menu is a sequence of courses with syntagmatic relations governing their arrangement like beginning with a starter followed by a main course and a dessert some sign systems use nonlinear arrangements such as traffic signs combining the shape of a sign with the symbol it shows paradigmatic relations are links between signs that belong to the same structural category they specify which elements can occupy a particular position and can substitute for each other without breaking the systems rules for example in the sentence the man sleeps the word man stands in paradigmatic relations to words like woman child and person because substituting them also results in a correct sentence for the dinner menu the same holds for the different options for the dessert such as cake ice cream and fruit salad in the case of traffic signs there are paradigmatic relations between the shape options such as triangle and circle the meaning of the chosen paradigmatic option is influenced by the absent options which form a background of meaningful alternatives in natural language these alternatives are typically related to specific word classes for instance when a particular word position in a sentence calls for a verb then the paradigmatic options consist of verbs another form of semiotic analysis examines sign pairs consisting of opposites where two signs denote contrasting features and exclude each other like the pairs goodbad hotcold and newold some contrasts involve a continuous scale with intermediate levels like fastslow whereas others are polar oppositions without degrees in between such as alivedead early structuralist philosophy is associated with the idea that meaning arises primarily from binary oppositions the semiotic square proposed by algirdas greimas offers a more finegrained differentiation it relates a sign such as rich to three contrasting terms its contradictory not rich its contrary poor and the contradictory of its contrary not poor another structural feature is asymmetric sign pairs where one item is unmarked and the other marked the unmarked sign is the generic and neutral expression often taken for granted whereas the marked sign is specialized and denotes additional features the unmarked term is more commonly used and is typically privileged as the default or norm examples are the pairs dogbitch daynight heshe and rightleft this asymmetry is of particular interest to the semiotic study of culture as a guide to implicit background assumptions and power relations for example patriarchal societies tend to use unmarked forms for masculine terms while unmarked forms for feminine terms are more common in matriarchal societies tropes semioticians study associative mechanisms through which a sign acquires alternative meanings by interacting with other signs this change in meaning can occur in cases where the literal meaning of a sign is inadequate or absurd leading to a shift toward a figurative meaning for example the term snake literally refers to a limbless reptile but has a different meaning in the sentence the professor is a snake the mechanisms through which this shift in meaning happens are called tropes discussions of tropes sometimes focus on four master tropes as the basis of most others metaphor metonymy synecdoche and irony a metaphor is an analogy in which attributes from one entity are carried over to another such as associating the snakelike attributes of being sneaky and coldblooded with a professor a metonymy is a way of referring to one object by naming another closely related thing like speaking of a king as the crown similarly a synecdoche is a way of referring to one object by naming one of its parts like speaking of ones car as my wheels the trope of irony works through dissimilarity literally expressing the opposite of what is meant such as remarking great job after a horrible failure semiotic tropes are primarily discussed in relation to linguistic sign systems where they are also known as figures of speech however their underlying mechanisms also affect nonlinguistic sign systems for example an advertisement for an airline may juxtapose the landing of a plane with the tranquil touchdown of a swan as a pictorial metaphor for grace and reliability comics often rely on pictorial metonymies to express emotions like a raised fist to stand for anger in photography closeups can function as synecdoches by presenting the whole through a part in film one type of audiovisual irony presents a horrific visual scene accompanied by incongruously cheerful music codes a code is a sign system used to communicate it includes a set of signs the meaning relations among them and the rules for combining them to create and interpret messages digital codes rely on clear and precise distinctions of how signs are formed and combined as in written language they contrast with analog codes which use continuous variations to convey meaning such as seamless gradations of color in painting simple codes include only few basic elements and relations as in the color code of traffic signals complex codes like the english language can encompass countless elements as well as syntactic and sociocultural norms involved in meaningmaking conventional codes are humanmade constructs including aesthetic codes used in the creation of artworks like music and painting they contrast with natural codes like dna which functions as a biochemical information system encoding hereditary information through nucleotide sequences semioticians analyze codes along several dimensions such as the domain and context they operate in the sensory channel they rely on and the function they perform some codes focus on the precise expression of knowledge such as mathematical formulas while others govern cultural and behavioral norms including conventions of politeness and ceremonial practices a code can have domainspecific subcodes that refine its scope of meaning or regulate usage in particular settings codes and subcodes are not static frameworks but can evolve as new conventions or technologies emerge code also plays a central role in models of communicationconceptual representations of the main components of communication many include the idea that a sender conveys a message through a channel to a receiver who interprets it and may respond with feedback encoding is the process of expressing meaning in the form of a message using the system of a specific code decoding is the reverse process of interpreting the message to understand its meaning in some cases different codes can be used to express the same message similarly messages can sometimes be translated from one code into another such as transcribing a written text into morse code discourse is the social use of language or other codes taking place at a specific moment in a particular context discourse analysis examines how meaning arises in a discourse considering the communicators and their respective roles as well as the influences of context and institutional backgrounds semioticians are also interested in how codes reflect and shape human perception of the world by influencing perception codes can affect behavior by making individuals aware of possible courses of action the controversial whorfian hypothesis suggests that language shapes thought by providing fundamental categories of understanding with the potential consequence that speakers of different languages think differently core branches general semiotics studies the nature of signs and their operation within sign systems in the widest sense independent of the domains to which they belong it contrasts with applied semiotics which examines signs in particular domains or from disciplinespecific perspectives an influential categorization proposed by morris divides general semiotics into three branches syntactics semantics and pragmatics syntactics studies formal relations between signs it investigates how signs combine to form compound signs and which rules govern this process for example the rules of grammar in natural languages specify how words may be arranged to form sentences and how different arrangements influence meaning as a result of the syntactic rules of the english language the expression elephants are big is grammatically correct whereas elephants big are is not syntactics is not limited to language and includes the study of nonlinguistic compound signs such as the arrangement of visual elements in geographic maps semantics studies the relation between signs and what they stand for examining how signs refer to concrete things and abstract ideas it typically focuses on the general meaning of a sign rather than its meaning in a particular context semantics addresses the meaning of both basic and compound signs in the linguistic domain it includes lexical semantics which explores word meaning and phrasal semantics which studies sentence meaning other areas include animal semantics which investigates for example how animal warning calls stand for predators pragmatics studies the relation between signs and sign users it examines how individuals produce and interpret signs in concrete contexts applying syntactic insights into formal structures and semantic insights into general meaning to reallife situations the pragmatic dimension of sign use in communication encompasses aspects such as social conventions and expectations speaker intention audience and other contextual factors for example it depends on the concrete situation whether the expression she found a mole refers to the discovery of an animal a skin mark or a spy various academic discussions address the relation between the three branches such as their relative importance or hierarchy historically syntactics and semantics have received more attention than pragmatics particularly in the study of linguistic sign systems one reason for this preferential treatment is the idea that sign usage is largely determined by what signs mean and how they can be combined as a result pragmatics has often been regarded as a secondary discipline reserved for diverse problems that could not be adequately addressed from the perspectives of the other two disciplines however this marginal treatment of pragmatics is questioned in the contemporary discourse some proposals reverse the priority and see pragmatics as the primary discipline one reason is the idea that syntactics and semantics are abstractions that cannot be scientifically studied on their own without examining actual sign use applications biology while traditional semiotics focuses on human communication and culture biosemiotics integrates this perspective with biology it studies how living beings produce and interpret signs through channels such as vision sound movement and chemical cues like smell it does not restrict sign processes to conscious mental activities and explicitly includes nonintentional processes within its scope biosemiotics has branches dedicated to different types of organisms such as zoosemiotics animals phytosemiotics plants bacteriosemiotics bacteria mycosemiotics fungi and protistosemiotics protists anthroposemiotics which addresses humans is sometimes included in zoosemiotics or treated as a distinct branch the scope of biosemiotics covers semiotic activities on different levels of organization ranging from cellular information processes to communication between distinct individuals at the microlevel there are sign activities within individual organisms for example genes encode information about hereditary traits and diverse biological processes decode and activate this information similarly hormones function as signaling molecules that control physiological functions by conveying information over long distances in the body biosemioticians also study how nerve cells communicate with each other and how neurotransmitters regulate this process this topic is more closely examined by neurosemiotics which investigates neural processes involved in sign interpretation and meaningmaking at the macrolevel there are sign processes between distinct organisms they happen primarily between individuals of the same species as forms of cooperation or coordination for example birds use calls to attract mates warn of predators and maintain territorial boundaries similar semiotic processes also happen in the plant kingdom such as airborne chemicals released by maple trees as a warning signal of herbivore attacks in some cases communication happens between members of distinct species for instance flowers use symmetrical shapes and vivid colors as signs to guide insects to nectar because of the pervasive nature of sign processes biosemioticians typically argue that semiosis is not a rare phenomenon limited to specific biological niches but an intrinsic feature of life in general culture several branches of applied semiotics study cultural phenomena which encompass systems of beliefs values norms and practices shared in society the semiotics of culture analyzes sign systems used in cultural practices by examining the meanings and ideological assumptions they embody it integrates findings from fields such as psychology anthropology archaeology linguistics and neuroscience it addresses both the fundamental characteristics of culture in general and the distinctive features of specific cultural formations such as myths aesthetics cuisine clothing rituals and artifacts on a more general level the semiotics of culture explores how culture differs from nature and which processes are responsible for the emergence of cultural formations social semiotics a related field studies sign practices as social phenomena in cultural contexts it also investigates the social construction of reality this includes semiotic practices that establish social meanings categories and norms shaping how people perceive the world and what they take for granted related fields include semiotic anthropology which analyzes how sign systems reproduce transmit and change culture and ethnosemiotics which examines and compares semiotic phenomena in specific ethnic groups semioticians have been particularly interested in cultural myths which they understand as structures of meaning that codify ideologies in this sense myths are not only a specific genre of literature but encompass widely shared views about human nature or the world for example pervasive ideological myths in western culture include the idea of progress which frames history as a linear series of improvements and individualism which conceives individuals as autonomous and selfreliant agents myths help people make sense of experience and guide behavior through common frameworks that conceptualize phenomena semiotic analysis sees myths as secondary sign systems that use other signs as vehicles to convey their ideas often in the form of metaphors for instance the image of a child represents a child on the literal level however it can at the same time embody a myth of childhood associated with innocence and purity motivating social arrangements associated with protection and parenting semioticians analyze this secondary level of signification across diverse media such as literature film and advertising in specific areas of culture semiotics examines the codes and conventions they employ and the meanings they produce the semiotics of clothing studies clothing as a nonverbal sign system clothes are often implicitly interpreted as signs of the personality and social status of the wearer covering features such as gender age and political beliefs different social occasions are associated with distinct dress codes such as uniforms for sport the military and religious rituals similarly the semiotics of food analyzes food items as bearers of cultural meanings it explores how culinary practices reflect social organization and belief systems like cooking methods table etiquette taboos against eating certain items the cultural roles of fasting and feasting and food symbolism research topics in popular internet culture include the codes and conventions of emojis and internet memes literature text semiotics studies the meanings of linguistic texts it typically focuses on larger fragments of discourse leaving the analysis of smaller units like phonemes to linguistics text semiotics plays a central role in literary criticism by exploring the codes conventions and tropes employed in literary texts it situates these insights within broader cultural and semiotic frameworks central schools of thought in text semiotics include structuralism and poststructuralism structuralism assumes that structural relations within sign systems are the primary source of meaning and understanding it examines how texts employ these patterns such as binary oppositions between good and evil or nature and culture often with the goal of identifying ideological biases poststructuralism argues that sign systems are selfreferential and cannot provide a stable representation of reality the poststructuralist method of deconstruction aims to reveal contradictions and ambiguities within texts for example by showing how a text unintentionally undermines a binary opposition on which it relies a historically influential tradition in text semiotics is hermeneuticsthe study of interpretation hermeneutics originates in the examination of mythological and religious texts it was used by medieval christian philosophers to decode the theological and moral doctrines of the bible for instance by distinguishing literal from spiritual meanings and analyzing symbolic structures associated with allegories modern hermeneutics extends these practices to secular texts the hermeneutic circle is a central concept in this field it is the idea that understanding involves a circular movement in which preconceptions guide interpretation and interpretation shapes preconceptions it is sometimes explained as an interplay where understanding the text as a whole depends on understanding its parts and vice versa it is debated whether there is a single correct interpretation of every text or whether incompatible interpretations can be valid at the same time narratology is a branch of semiotics that studies narrative texts such as tales and stories it assumes that there is a universal narrative code of the different elements found in narratives meaning that individual texts only express variations of the same underlying code for example according to algirdas julien greimass actantial model these elements include a subject such as the hero of the story an entity that they desire and an opponent or obstacle to their goal other research directions in text semiotics are stylistics and rhetorics which compare different styles and explore how texts persuade arts and media semiotics has diverse applications in the analysis of art and other media ranging from film and music to advertising and video games the field of media semiotics studies how meaning is produced interpreted and shared in media such as newspapers radio television and the internet understood in the widest sense it encompasses all channels of everyday communication including shop signs and posters in the visual arts semioticians examine how meaning is created through aspects such as color shape texture composition and perspective for example colors can express different moods emotions and atmospheres such as warm and soft colors in contrast to cold and harsh ones colors can also have culturespecific symbolic meanings such as pink signifying femininity semioticians are further interested in the representational dimension of images studying how they may act as icons that represent their motive through similarity in photography images may additionally function as indexical signs because of the causal connection between the depicted object and the photograph musical semiotics studies music as a meaningmaking process involving signifiers and signifieds there is substantial disagreement about the extent to which music is a semiotic activity some theoretical attempts treat sounds as individual signs and compositions as compound signs or messages while others argue that sounds and compositions signify nothing beyond themselves another research approach investigates the cultural significance of music for example how musical styles like heavy metal reggae and classical music are associated with different subcultures and lifestyles film semiotics analyzes films as sign activities exploring how visual and auditory codes interact some theorists compare films to language arguing that individual shots act as words and that montages which combine several shots correspond to sentences a key difference to many other forms of language is that film involves asymmetrical communication since there is usually no direct way for spectators to respond to messages the semiotics of architecture another field examines how buildings communicate meaning including their practical functions historical heritage and social significance the semiotics of advertising studies how advertisements use and combine signs to influence consumers advertisements typically combine linguistic and nonlinguistic codes for instance print ads typically use language for the brand name and verbal commentary while visual elements convey nonverbal messages to the target audience in many cases the core message related to the economic reality of selling a product is not stated explicitly instead an indirect message is used to make the product appealing computer games integrate elements from many other media and combine them with an interactive dimension they include diverse sign elements for example to explain how to interact with the virtual world set goals provide feedback and establish a narrative cognition cognitive semiotics is an interdisciplinary field that examines how mental processes contribute to meaningmaking it integrates insights of diverse disciplines covering semiotics cognitive science linguistics anthropology psychology and philosophy cognitive semioticians study sign activity from complementary perspectives the subjective firstperson perspective the intersubjective secondperson perspective and the objective thirdperson perspective while acknowledging the validity of each perspective in its respective area the field privileges firstperson and secondperson methods as offering more direct access to the mental dimension of meaning for example it relies on the phenomenological description to analyze how sign processes shape experience by examining how meaning operates in the mind it contrasts with certain aspects of biosemiotics that address sign processes without mental activity like in genetics cognitive semioticians typically understand mind and cognition in terms of practical engagement with the world rather than theoretical attempts to model or depict it they argue that meaning includes representation as one way of engaging with the world but is not limited to it their primary focus is on nonrepresentational forms of meaning such as habits values and other ways how individuals attune to their environment from this perspective sign structures are understood as processes that shape habits and dispositions to act in different circumstances emphasizing that meaning is a dynamic process rather than a static product the theory of finite semiotics explains semiosis as an effect of the finite nature of the human mind that occurs as an individual passes from one cognitive state to another others in the field of nonverbal communication semioticians investigate the exchange of information without linguistic sign systems for example body language includes signifying practices like raising a thumb and other gestures as well as facial expressions like laughing and frowning other types of nonverbal communication encompass touching behavior like shaking hands or kissing and the use of personal space such as the distance between speakers to express their degree of familiarity paralanguage encompasses nonverbal elements of linguistic messages for instance pitch and loudness in a conversation can express emotion or emphasis without stating them explicitly semiotics has various applications in psychoanalysis sigmund freud proposed a theory of dream interpretation to understand and resolve psychological conflicts he argued that dream elements act as symbols that stand for unconscious desires and fears for example dreams of losing a tooth can signify castration or fear of impotence semiotics also plays a central role in the psychoanalytic theory of jacques lacan who argued that the unconscious is structured like a language in the field of computing semiotics has been used to describe programming languages and analyze humancomputer interaction there are also attempts to develop formal theories of semiotics allowing computational processes to perform semiotic analyses cybersemiotics another approach combines biosemiotics with cybernetics to provide a unified framework of semiotic processes across biological social and technological domains edusemiotics is a research movement that conceptualizes semiotic activity as the foundation of educational theory for instance it understands teaching and learning as sign processes semioethics is a critical approach that examines the ethical dimension of sign activities it seeks to diagnose problems that arise in the context of global communication medical semiotics studies how disease symptoms such as pain dizziness and fever indicate medical conditions legal semiotics investigates sign activities in legal practice including the interpretation of evidence testimony and legal texts methods semioticians use diverse methods to analyze and compare signs and sign systems different domains of signs and perspectives of inquiry typically call for distinct techniques depending on the forms of representation and modes of meaningmaking under study as a result there is no universally adopted methodology but only an interdisciplinary loosely connected set of approaches within a given domain semioticians typically seek to determine what meaning is produced why it emerges the way it does and how it is encoded structural analysis examines the structural framework of texts and sign systems exploring the syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations underlying signification the commutation test is an influential tool for structural analysis it explores how the meanings of linguistic and nonlinguistic texts are shaped by their components and what roles specific signs play in this process it proceeds by changing certain elements of a text either actually or as a thought experiment and assesses whether or how this change affects the overall meaning for example in the analysis of an advertisement a semiotician may probe whether the overall message changes if a woman is shown using the product instead of a man if it does then gender is a signifying element the way how the overall message changes provides insights into the semiotic role of the changed aspect the commutation test can be applied to a wide range of elements or features such as shape size color camera angle typeface age class and ethnicity instead of replacing one element with another other versions of the commutation test add or remove elements to explore for instance what draws attention by its absence or what is taken for granted in the study of cultural sign systems semioticians often focus on hidden meanings and connotations such as ideological messages and power dynamics that influence meaningmaking without being immediately apparent to observers this dimension can be studied in diverse ways such as comparing marked and unmarked terms to reveal how cultural norms privilege certain meanings and marginalize others critical discourse analysis has a similar goal seeking to understand how texts and social reality shape each other it is particularly interested in how ideologies and power relations are reproduced in discourse for example by analyzing how political actors depict immigrants as threats to promote restrictive immigration policies another approach to semiotics focuses on the historical dimension of sign systems and semiotic practices it examines how they came into existence and evolved studying how the relevant codes and media developed and how new conventions and genres emerged the historical inquiry also considers the effects of technological developments for instance by tracing how the invention of the printing press and the internet have shaped the way people engage with written texts although qualitative investigation is the dominant approach in semiotics some researchers also use quantitative methods for example many forms of content analysis examine objective patterns found in an individual document or an entire discourse and employ statistical analysis to discover systematic patterns in sign usage applied to the news coverage of a violent incident a content analyst may gather statistical information about how often the perpetrators are described as rebels rather than terrorists quantitative data on its own is usually not sufficient to explain complex semiotic processes which is why content analysis is typically combined with other approaches in applied semiotics researchers often tailor their approach to the specific area of signs under investigation for instance biosemioticians may adapt concepts intended for linguistic analysis to biological codes like dna in some cases this requires conceptual modifications for example when terms like interpretation are applied to sign processes without a conscious subject history the study of signs has its origin in antiquity early approaches examined concrete patterns that indicate underlying conditions or future outcomes such as medical diagnosis and divination some mesopotamian tablets from the rd millennium bce document this practice such as the interpretation of the moons visibility as a sign of an impending drought in ancient greek thought hippocrates  bce and later galen of pergamum c  ce investigated medical signs as indications of underlying diseases establishing semeiosis or symptomatology as a branch of medicine in philosophy plato  bce explored whether the relation between linguistic signs and their referents is natural or conventional his student aristotle  bce distinguished verbal from nonverbal signs he argued that verbal signs represent mental states which refer to external things while nonverbal signs guide inference to expand knowledge starting in the rd century bce the stoics defended a triadic model of signs understanding sign vehicle and referent as material objects linked through nonmaterial meaning in the same period the epicureans proposed a dyadic model emphasizing a direct connection between sign vehicle and referent without meaning as a separate component to link them philodemus c  bce provided a detailed overview of discussions about the epicurean theory of signs such as whether signs function as inferences from the known to the unknown in ancient india various schools of hinduism examined semiotic phenomena nyaya studied the relations between names things and knowledge while mimamsa addressed the connection between word meaning and sentence meaning the philosopher bhartrhari thth century ce developed and compared theories of meaning arguing that sentences are the primary bearers of meaning he asserted that cognition depends on linguistic categorization for example that names make it possible to individuate and perceive distinct objects semiotic thought is also present in buddhist philosophy the mahayanasutraalamkarakarika a text from the th century ce explored the spiritual role of semiosis suggesting that the soteriological goal is to transform cognition in such a way that semiotic activity ceases in ancient china mohism understood sign use as the practical skill of drawing distinctions and argued that public intersubjective standards ground meaning the school of names explored the relation between names and things they practiced a method of public disputation for example to decide whether two names refer to the same thing or to different things as a forerunner of semiotics in the medieval period augustine  drew on stoic epicurean and christian ideas to develop one of the first systematic theories of signs he examined the relations between signs meanings and interpreters augustines theory included nonlinguistic signs based on the distinction between natural and conventional signs boethius  analyzed sign activity as a chain of signification writing refers to speech speech expresses mental concepts and mental concepts represent external things peter abelard  studied nonlinguistic sign processes such as images and conventional gestures the most detailed medieval account of signs was proposed by roger bacon c  who understood signs as triadic relations between sign vehicle represented thing and interpreter he developed a complex classification that distinguishes between natural signs and signs directed by the soul with several subtypes in each category the modist grammarians proposed that all languages share a universal grammar that reflects the shared structure of modes of being understanding and signifying william of sherwood c  peter of spain c  and william of ockham c  formulated contextual theories of meaning and reference in the islamic world philosophers explored semiotic topics from a religious perspective they addressed the problem of how to interpret signs of allah in the quran and whether to describe allah by affirming or negating attributes influential theorists were alkindi alfarabi and avicenna in the early modern period john poinsot  integrated ideas of thomas aquinas  to investigate how signs mediate between objective reality and subjective experience the portroyal school another tradition formulated a mindbased theory of signs it argued that signs consist of two ideas one for the representing entity and one for the represented entity gottfried wilhelm leibniz  understood signs as visible marks that stand for ideas he saw them as indispensable tools of thought enabling operations on complex semantic concepts without apprehending them in full john locke  proposed a general science or doctrine of signs to examine the link between knowledge and representation he distinguished two types of signs ideas are signs of things and words are signs of ideas effectively functioning as signs of signs christian wolff  and johann heinrich lambert  both developed theories of signs while focusing on how knowledge depends on sign activity in the late th and early th centuries semiotics emerged as a distinct field of inquiry the twin origins of this process lie in the works of the philosopher charles sanders peirce  and the linguist ferdinand de saussure  who separately articulated the foundational principles of the discipline peirce developed a triadic model understanding signs as relations that can apply to any sign vehicle that is interpreted to stand for something else he distinguished different types of relations between sign vehicle and referent and used this distinction to classify signs as indices icons and symbols as a pragmatist peirce focused on the effects of sign processes while emphasizing the dynamic nature of meaning charles w morris  popularized peircean semiotics and integrated it with behaviorism he conceptualized syntactics semantics and pragmatics as the main branches of the field saussure proposed a dyadic model that understands signs as relations in the mind between a sensible form and a concept he emphasized the arbitrary nature of this relation and explored how signs form sign systems such as language saussure distinguished synchronic or static from diachronic or historical aspects of language he formulated the foundations of structuralism to investigate how differences between signs such as binary oppositions are the primary mechanism of meaning based on saussures structuralism louis hjelmslev  developed glossematics which divides language into basic units defined only by the formal functions they play in a sign system focused on articulating a general semiotics algirdas julien greimas  expanded glossematics and applied it to narratology aiming to discern a universal code underlying narrative texts claude levistrauss  employed the principles of structural semiotics to engage in ethnology analyzing myths and cultural practices as sign systems that reveal how different cultures make sense of the world roland barthes  used the theories of saussure and hjelmslev to study literature and media covering signifying processes in myths theology pictures advertising and fashion in these fields he often examined how connotations encode subtle ideological messages using the phenomenological method edmund husserl  studied the nature of signs and meaning through the description of experience he contrasted the direct awareness of objects in perception with the indirect awareness of objects that refer to something other than themselves in psychoanalysis sigmund freud  interpreted dream elements as signs of unconscious desires jacques lacan  expanded freuds ideas analyzing the structure of the unconscious as a sign system drawing on psychoanalysis and feminism julia kristeva present has explored the problem of intertextuality and conceptualized the semiotic and the symbolic as two contrasting dimensions of signification jakob von uexkull  pioneered the study of animal and plant semiosis he understood the interaction between organism and environment as a process of sign exchange in which individuals respond to cues that are relevant to their speciesspecific needs and capacities uexkull argued that different species inhabit distinct perceptual worlds based on their selective interpretation of cues thomas a sebeok  relied on uexkulls ideas to establish biosemiotics as a branch of semiotics covering sign processes within and between organisms such as animals plants and fungi roman jakobson  contributed to various schools of thought including russian formalism the prague school and the copenhagen school adopting structuralism he reinterpreted saussures dyadic model and later incorporated peircean ideas such as an emphasis on contextual factors yuri lotman  engaged in cultural semiotics analyzing cultural formations in terms of models that showcase distinctive features of their origin culture umberto eco  understood semiotics as the study of communicative processes in culture focusing the field on conventional codes he explored the idea of unlimited semiosis according to which the interpretation of signs is an openended process leading to further signs jacques derrida  was an influential proponent of poststructuralism he developed the method of deconstruction to discover internal ambiguities and contradictions within texts the second half of the th century saw the emergence of many journals dedicated to semiotics while international institutions such as the international association for semiotic studies were established see also ecosemiotics  branch of semiotics index of semiotics articles outline of semiotics
