publickey cryptography or asymmetric cryptography is the field of cryptographic systems that use pairs of related keys each key pair consists of a public key and a corresponding private key key pairs are generated with algorithms based on mathematical problems termed oneway functions security of publickey cryptography depends on keeping the private key secret the public key can be openly distributed without compromising security there are many kinds of publickey cryptosystems with different security goals including digital signature diffiehellman key exchange publickey key encapsulation and publickey encryption public key algorithms are fundamental security primitives in modern cryptosystems including applications and protocols that offer assurance of the confidentiality and authenticity of electronic communications and data storage they underpin numerous internet standards such as transport layer security tls ssh smime and pgp compared to symmetric cryptography publickey cryptography can be too slow for many purposes so these protocols often combine symmetric cryptography with publickey cryptography in hybrid cryptosystems description before the mids all cipher systems used symmetric key algorithms in which the same cryptographic key is used with the underlying algorithm by both the sender and the recipient who must both keep it secret of necessity the key in every such system had to be exchanged between the communicating parties in some secure way prior to any use of the system  for instance via a secure channel this requirement is never trivial and very rapidly becomes unmanageable as the number of participants increases or when secure channels are not available or when as is sensible cryptographic practice keys are frequently changed in particular if messages are meant to be secure from other users a separate key is required for each possible pair of users by contrast in a publickey cryptosystem the public keys can be disseminated widely and openly and only the corresponding private keys need be kept secret the two bestknown types of public key cryptography are digital signature and publickey encryption in a digital signature system a sender can use a private key together with a message to create a signature anyone with the corresponding public key can verify whether the signature matches the message but a forger who does not know the private key cannot find any messagesignature pair that will pass verification with the public keyfor example a software publisher can create a signature key pair and include the public key in software installed on computers later the publisher can distribute an update to the software signed using the private key and any computer receiving an update can confirm it is genuine by verifying the signature using the public key as long as the software publisher keeps the private key secret even if a forger can distribute malicious updates to computers they cannot convince the computers that any malicious updates are genuine in a publickey encryption system anyone with a public key can encrypt a message yielding a ciphertext but only those who know the corresponding private key can decrypt the ciphertext to obtain the original messagefor example a journalist can publish the public key of an encryption key pair on a web site so that sources can send secret messages to the news organization in ciphertextonly the journalist who knows the corresponding private key can decrypt the ciphertexts to obtain the sources messagesan eavesdropper reading email on its way to the journalist cannot decrypt the ciphertexts however publickey encryption does not conceal metadata like what computer a source used to send a message when they sent it or how long it is publickey encryption on its own also does not tell the recipient anything about who sent a messageit just conceals the content of the message applications built on publickey cryptography include authenticating web servers with tls digital cash passwordauthenticated key agreement authenticating and concealing email content with openpgp or smime and timestamping services and nonrepudiation protocols one important issue is confidenceproof that a particular public key is authentic ie that it is correct and belongs to the person or entity claimed and has not been tampered with or replaced by some perhaps malicious third party there are several possible approaches including a public key infrastructure pki in which one or more third parties  known as certificate authorities  certify ownership of key pairs tls relies upon this this implies that the pki system software hardware and management is trustable by all involved a web of trust decentralizes authentication by using individual endorsements of links between a user and the public key belonging to that user pgp uses this approach in addition to lookup in the domain name system dns the dkim system for digitally signing emails also uses this approach hybrid cryptosystems because asymmetric key algorithms are nearly always much more computationally intensive than symmetric ones it is common to use a publicprivate asymmetric keyexchange algorithm to encrypt and exchange a symmetric key which is then used by symmetrickey cryptography to transmit data using the nowshared symmetric key for a symmetric key encryption algorithm pgp ssh and the ssltls family of schemes use this procedure they are thus called hybrid cryptosystems the initial asymmetric cryptographybased key exchange to share a servergenerated symmetric key from the server to client has the advantage of not requiring that a symmetric key be preshared manually such as on printed paper or discs transported by a courier while providing the higher data throughput of symmetric key cryptography over asymmetric key cryptography for the remainder of the shared connection weaknesses as with all securityrelated systems there are various potential weaknesses in publickey cryptography aside from poor choice of an asymmetric key algorithm there are few that are widely regarded as satisfactory or too short a key length the chief security risk is that the private key of a pair becomes known all security of messages authentication etc encrypted with this private key will then be lost this is commonly mitigated such as in recent tls schemes by using forward secrecy capable schemes that generate an ephemeral set of keys during the communication which must also be known for the communication to be compromised additionally with the advent of quantum computing many asymmetric key algorithms are considered vulnerable to attacks and new quantumresistant schemes are being developed to overcome the problem beyond algorithmic or keylength weaknesses some studies have noted risks when private key control is delegated to third parties research on uruguays implementation of public key infrastructure under law  found that centralized key custody by trust service providers tsps may weaken the principle of privatekey secrecy increasing exposure to maninthemiddle attacks and raising concerns about legal nonrepudiation algorithms all public key schemes are in theory susceptible to a bruteforce key search attack however such an attack is impractical if the amount of computation needed to succeed  termed the work factor by claude shannon  is out of reach of all potential attackers in many cases the work factor can be increased by simply choosing a longer key but other algorithms may inherently have much lower work factors making resistance to a bruteforce attack eg from longer keys irrelevant some special and specific algorithms have been developed to aid in attacking some public key encryption algorithms both rsa and elgamal encryption have known attacks that are much faster than the bruteforce approach none of these are sufficiently improved to be actually practical however major weaknesses have been found for several formerly promising asymmetric key algorithms the knapsack packing algorithm was found to be insecure after the development of a new attack as with all cryptographic functions publickey implementations may be vulnerable to sidechannel attacks that exploit information leakage to simplify the search for a secret key these are often independent of the algorithm being used research is underway to both discover and to protect against new attacks alteration of public keys another potential security vulnerability in using asymmetric keys is the possibility of a maninthemiddle attack in which the communication of public keys is intercepted by a third party the man in the middle and then modified to provide different public keys instead encrypted messages and responses must in all instances be intercepted decrypted and reencrypted by the attacker using the correct public keys for the different communication segments so as to avoid suspicion a communication is said to be insecure where data is transmitted in a manner that allows for interception also called sniffing these terms refer to reading the senders private data in its entirety a communication is particularly unsafe when interceptions can not be prevented or monitored by the sender a maninthemiddle attack can be difficult to implement due to the complexities of modern security protocols however the task becomes simpler when a sender is using insecure media such as public networks the internet or wireless communication in these cases an attacker can compromise the communications infrastructure rather than the data itself a hypothetical malicious staff member at an internet service provider isp might find a maninthemiddle attack relatively straightforward capturing the public key would only require searching for the key as it gets sent through the isps communications hardware in properly implemented asymmetric key schemes this is not a significant risk in some advanced maninthemiddle attacks one side of the communication will see the original data while the other will receive a malicious variant asymmetric maninthemiddle attacks can prevent users from realizing their connection is compromised this remains so even when one users data is known to be compromised because the data appears fine to the other user this can lead to confusing disagreements between users such as it must be on your end when neither user is at fault hence maninthemiddle attacks are only fully preventable when the communications infrastructure is physically controlled by one or both parties such as via a wired route inside the senders own building in summation public keys are easier to alter when the communications hardware used by a sender is controlled by an attacker public key infrastructure one approach to prevent such attacks involves the use of a public key infrastructure pki a set of roles policies and procedures needed to create manage distribute use store and revoke digital certificates and manage publickey encryption however this has potential weaknesses for example the certificate authority issuing the certificate must be trusted by all participating parties to have properly checked the identity of the keyholder to have ensured the correctness of the public key when it issues a certificate to be secure from computer piracy and to have made arrangements with all participants to check all their certificates before protected communications can begin web browsers for instance are supplied with a long list of selfsigned identity certificates from pki providers  these are used to check the bona fides of the certificate authority and then in a second step the certificates of potential communicators an attacker who could subvert one of those certificate authorities into issuing a certificate for a bogus public key could then mount a maninthemiddle attack as easily as if the certificate scheme were not used at all an attacker who penetrates an authoritys servers and obtains its store of certificates and keys public and private would be able to spoof masquerade decrypt and forge transactions without limit assuming that they were able to place themselves in the communication stream despite its theoretical and potential problems public key infrastructure is widely used examples include tls and its predecessor ssl which are commonly used to provide security for web browser transactions for example most websites utilize tls for https aside from the resistance to attack of a particular key pair the security of the certification hierarchy must be considered when deploying public key systems some certificate authority  usually a purposebuilt program running on a server computer  vouches for the identities assigned to specific private keys by producing a digital certificate public key digital certificates are typically valid for several years at a time so the associated private keys must be held securely over that time when a private key used for certificate creation higher in the pki server hierarchy is compromised or accidentally disclosed then a maninthemiddle attack is possible making any subordinate certificate wholly insecure unencrypted metadata most of the available publickey encryption software does not conceal metadata in the message header which might include the identities of the sender and recipient the sending date subject field and the software they use etc rather only the body of the message is concealed and can only be decrypted with the private key of the intended recipient this means that a third party could construct quite a detailed model of participants in a communication network along with the subjects being discussed even if the message body itself is hidden however there has been a recent demonstration of messaging with encrypted headers which obscures the identities of the sender and recipient and significantly reduces the available metadata to a third party the concept is based around an open repository containing separately encrypted metadata blocks and encrypted messages only the intended recipient is able to decrypt the metadata block and having done so they can identify and download their messages and decrypt them such a messaging system is at present in an experimental phase and not yet deployed scaling this method would reveal to the third party only the inbox server being used by the recipient and the timestamp of sending and receiving the server could be shared by thousands of users making social network modelling much more challenging history during the early history of cryptography two parties would rely upon a key that they would exchange by means of a secure but noncryptographic method such as a facetoface meeting or a trusted courier this key which both parties must then keep absolutely secret could then be used to exchange encrypted messages a number of significant practical difficulties arise with this approach to distributing keys anticipation in his  book the principles of science william stanley jevons wrote can the reader say what two numbers multiplied together will produce the number  i think it unlikely that anyone but myself will ever know here he described the relationship of oneway functions to cryptography and went on to discuss specifically the factorization problem used to create a trapdoor function in july  mathematician solomon w golomb said jevons anticipated a key feature of the rsa algorithm for public key cryptography although he certainly did not invent the concept of public key cryptography classified discovery in  james h ellis a british cryptographer at the uk government communications headquarters gchq conceived of the possibility of nonsecret encryption now called public key cryptography but could see no way to implement it in  his colleague clifford cocks implemented what has become known as the rsa encryption algorithm giving a practical method of nonsecret encryption and in  another gchq mathematician and cryptographer malcolm j williamson developed what is now known as diffiehellman key exchange the scheme was also passed to the uss national security agency both organisations had a military focus and only limited computing power was available in any case the potential of public key cryptography remained unrealised by either organization according to ralph benjamin i judged it most important for military use  if you can share your key rapidly and electronically you have a major advantage over your opponent only at the end of the evolution from bernerslee designing an open internet architecture for cern its adaptation and adoption for the arpanet  did public key cryptography realise its full potential these discoveries were not publicly acknowledged until the research was declassified by the british government in  public discovery in  an asymmetric key cryptosystem was published by whitfield diffie and martin hellman who influenced by ralph merkles work on public key distribution disclosed a method of public key agreement this method of key exchange which uses exponentiation in a finite field came to be known as diffiehellman key exchange this was the first published practical method for establishing a shared secretkey over an authenticated but not confidential communications channel without using a prior shared secret merkles public keyagreement technique became known as merkles puzzles and was invented in  and only published in  this makes asymmetric encryption a rather new field in cryptography although cryptography itself dates back more than  years in  a generalization of cockss scheme was independently invented by ron rivest adi shamir and leonard adleman all then at mit the latter authors published their work in  in martin gardners scientific american column and the algorithm came to be known as rsa from their initials rsa uses exponentiation modulo a product of two very large primes to encrypt and decrypt performing both public key encryption and public key digital signatures its security is connected to the extreme difficulty of factoring large integers a problem for which there is no known efficient general technique a description of the algorithm was published in the mathematical games column in the august  issue of scientific american since the s a large number and variety of encryption digital signature key agreement and other techniques have been developed including the rabin signature elgamal
