in computing plain text is a loose term for data eg file contents that represent only characters of readable material but not its graphical representation nor other objects floatingpoint numbers images etc it may also include a limited number of whitespace characters that affect simple arrangement of text such as spaces line breaks or tabulation characters plain text is different from formatted text where style information is included from structured text where structural parts of the document such as paragraphs sections and the like are identified and from binary files in which some portions must be interpreted as binary objects encoded integers real numbers images etc the term is sometimes used quite loosely to mean files that contain only readable content or just files with nothing that the speaker does not prefer for example that could exclude any indication of fonts or layout such as markup markdown or even tabs characters such as curly quotes nonbreaking spaces soft hyphens em dashes andor ligatures or other things in principle plain text can be in any encoding but occasionally the term is taken to imply ascii as unicodebased encodings such as utf and utf become more common that usage may be shrinking plain text is also sometimes used only to exclude binary files those in which at least some parts of the file cannot be correctly interpreted via the character encoding in effect for example a file or string consisting of hello in any encoding following by  bytes that express a binary integer that is not a character is a binary file converting a plain text file to a different character encoding does not change the meaning of the text as long as the correct character encoding is used however converting a binary file to a different format may alter the interpretation of the nontextual data plain text and rich text according to the unicode standard plain text is a pure sequence of character codes plain unencoded text is therefore a sequence of unicode character codes in contrast styled text also known as rich text is any text representation containing plain text plus added information such as a language identifier font size color hypertext links and so on sgml rtf html xml and tex are examples of rich text fully represented as plain text streams interspersing plain text data with sequences of characters that represent the additional data structures according to other definitions however files that contain markup or other metadata are generally considered plain text so long as the markup is also in a directly humanreadable form as in html xml and so on thus representations such as sgml rtf html xml wiki markup and tex as well as nearly all programming language source code files are considered plain text the particular content is irrelevant to whether a file is plain text for example an svg file can express drawings or even bitmapped graphics but is still plain text the use of plain text rather than binary files enables files to survive much better in the wild in part by making them largely immune to computer architecture incompatibilities for example with all data encoded as utf text all the problems of endianness can be avoided usage the purpose of using plain text today is primarily independence from programs that require their very own special encoding or formatting or file format plain text files can be opened read and edited with ubiquitous text editors and utilities a commandline interface allows people to give commands in plain text and get a response also typically in plain text many other computer programs are also capable of processing or creating plain text such as countless programs in dos windows classic mac os and unix and its kin as well as web browsers a few browsers such as lynx and the line mode browser produce only plain text for display and other etext readers plain text files are almost universal in programming a source code file containing instructions in a programming language is almost always a plain text file plain text is also commonly used for configuration files which are read for saved settings at the startup of a program plain text is used for much email a comment a txt file or a txt record generally contains only plain text without formatting intended for humans to read the best format for storing knowledge persistently is plain text rather than some binary format encoding character encodings before the early s computers were mainly used for numbercrunching rather than for text and memory was extremely expensive computers often allocated only  bits for each character permitting only  charactersassigning codes for az az and  would leave only  codes nowhere near enough most computers opted not to support lowercase letters thus early text projects such as roberto busas index thomisticus the brown corpus and others had to resort to conventions such as keying an asterisk preceding letters actually intended to be uppercase fred brooks of ibm argued strongly for going to bit bytes because someday people might want to process text and won although ibm used ebcdic most text from then on came to be encoded in ascii using values from  to  for nonprinting control characters and values from  to  for graphic characters such as letters digits and punctuation most machines stored characters in  bits rather than  ignoring the remaining bit or using it as a checksum the nearubiquity of ascii was a great help but failed to address international and linguistic concerns the dollarsign  was not as useful in england and the accented characters used in spanish french german portuguese italian and many other languages were entirely unavailable in ascii not to mention characters used in greek russian and most eastern languages many individuals companies and countries defined extra characters as neededoften reassigning control characters or using values in the range from  to  using values above  conflicts with using the th bit as a checksum but the checksum usage gradually died out these additional characters were encoded differently in different countries making texts impossible to decode without figuring out the originators rules for instance a browser might display a rather than  if it tried to interpret one character set as another the international organization for standardization iso eventually developed several code pages under iso  to accommodate various languages the first of these iso  is also known as latin and covers the needs of most not all european languages that use latinbased characters there was not quite enough room to cover them all iso  then provided conventions for switching between different character sets in midfile many other organisations developed variations on these and for many years windows and macintosh computers used incompatible variations the textencoding situation became more and more complex leading to efforts by iso and by the unicode consortium to develop a single unified character encoding that could cover all known or at least all currently known languages after some conflict these efforts were unified unicode currently allows for  code values and assigns codes covering nearly all modern text writing systems as well as many historical ones and for many nonlinguistic characters such as printers dingbats mathematical symbols etc text is considered plain text regardless of its encoding to properly understand or process it the recipient must know or be able to figure out what encoding was used however they need not know anything about the computer architecture that was used or about the binary structures defined by whatever program if any created the data perhaps the most common way of explicitly stating the specific encoding of plain text is with a mime type for email and http the default mime type is textplain  plain text without markup another mime type often used in both email and http is texthtml charsetutf  plain text represented using the utf character encoding with html markup another common mime type is applicationjson  plain text represented using the utf character encoding with json markup when a document is received without any explicit indication of the character encoding some applications use charset detection to attempt to guess what encoding was used control codes ascii reserves the first  codes numbers  decimal for control characters known as the c set codes originally intended not to represent printable information but rather to control devices such as printers that make use of ascii or to provide metainformation about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape they include common characters like the newline and the tab character in bit character sets such as latin and the other iso  sets the first  characters of the upper half  to  are also control codes known as the c set they are rarely used directly when they turn up in documents which are ostensibly in an iso  encoding their code positions generally refer instead to the characters at that position in a proprietary systemspecific encoding such as windows or mac os roman that use the codes to instead provide additional graphic characters unicode defines additional control characters including bidirectional text direction override characters used to explicitly mark righttoleft writing inside lefttoright writing and the other way around and variation selectors to select alternate forms of cjk ideographs emoji and other characters see also binary data binary
