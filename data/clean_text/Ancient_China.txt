the history of china spans several millennia across a wide geographical area each region now considered part of the chinese world has experienced periods of unity fracture prosperity and strife chinese civilization was traditionally thought to have first emerged in the yellow river or huang he valley which along with the yangtze basin constitutes the geographic core of the chinese cultural sphere however current views have considered the origin to be a simultaneous duality of both the yellow river and the yangtze china maintains a rich diversity of ethnic and linguistic people groups the traditional lens for viewing chinese history is the dynastic cycle imperial dynasties rise and fall and are ascribed certain achievements this lens also tends to assume chinese civilization can be traced as an unbroken thread many thousands of years into the past making it one of the cradles of civilization at various times states representative of a dominant chinese culture have directly controlled areas stretching as far west as the tian shan the tarim basin and the himalayas as far north as the sayan mountains and as far south as the delta of the red river the neolithic period saw increasingly complex polities begin to emerge along the yellow and yangtze rivers the erlitou culture in the central plains of china is sometimes identified with the xia dynasty rd millennium bc of traditional chinese historiography the earliest surviving written chinese dates to roughly  bc consisting of divinations inscribed on oracle bones in the shang dynasty the oldest confirmed dynasty due to such relics in  chinese bronze inscriptions ritual texts dedicated to ancestors form another large corpus of early chinese writing the earliest strata of received literature in chinese include poetry divination and records of official speeches china is believed to be one of a very few loci of independent invention of writing and the earliest surviving records display an alreadymature written language the culture remembered by the earliest extant literature is that of the zhou dynasty c    bc chinas axial age during which the mandate of heaven was introduced and foundations laid for philosophies such as confucianism taoism legalism and wuxing china was first united under a single imperial state by qin shi huang in  bc orthography weights measures and law were all standardized shortly thereafter china entered its classical era with the han dynasty  bc   ad marking a critical period a term for the chinese language is still han language and the dominant chinese ethnic group is known as han chinese the chinese empire reached some of its farthest geographical extents during this period confucianism was officially sanctioned and its core texts were edited into their received forms wealthy landholding families independent of the ancient aristocracy began to wield significant power han technology can be considered on par with that of the contemporaneous roman empire mass production of paper aided the proliferation of written documents and the written language of this period was employed for millennia afterwards china became known internationally for its sericulture when the han imperial order finally collapsed after four centuries china entered an equally lengthy period of disunity during which buddhism began to have a significant impact on chinese culture while calligraphy art historiography and storytelling flourished wealthy families in some cases became more powerful than the central government the yangtze river valley was incorporated into the dominant cultural sphere a period of unity began in  with the sui dynasty which soon gave way to the longlived tang dynasty  regarded as another chinese golden age the tang dynasty saw flourishing developments in science technology poetry economics and geographical influence chinas only officially recognized empress wu zetian reigned during the dynastys first century buddhism was adopted by tang emperors tang people is the other common demonym for the han ethnic group after the tang fractured the song dynasty  saw the maximal extent of imperial chinese cosmopolitan development mechanical printing was introduced and many of the earliest surviving witnesses of certain texts are woodblock prints from this era song scientific advancement led the world and the imperial examination system gave ideological structure to the political bureaucracy confucianism and taoism were fully knit together in neoconfucianism eventually the mongol empire conquered all of china establishing the yuan dynasty in  contact with europe began to increase during this time achievements under the subsequent ming dynasty  include global exploration fine porcelain and many extant public works projects such as those restoring the grand canal and great wall three of the four classic chinese novels were written during the ming the qing dynasty that succeeded the ming was ruled by ethnic manchu people the qianlong emperor r  commissioned a complete encyclopaedia of imperial libraries totaling nearly a billion words imperial china reached its greatest territorial extent during the qing but china came into increasing conflict with european powers culminating in the opium wars and subsequent unequal treaties the  xinhai revolution led by sun yatsen and others created the republic of china from  to  a costly civil war roiled between the republican government under chiang kaishek and the communistaligned chinese red army interrupted by the industrialized empire of japan invading the divided country until its defeat in the second world war after the communist victory mao zedong proclaimed the establishment of the peoples republic of china prc in  with the roc retreating to taiwan both governments still claim sole legitimacy of the entire mainland area the prc has slowly accumulated the majority of diplomatic recognition and taiwans status remains disputed to this day from  to  the

erectus to contemporary h sapiens is debated the three main theories include the dominant out of africa theory ooa the regional continuity model and the admixture variant of the ooa hypothesis regardless the earliest modern humans have been dated to china at  bp based on fossilized teeth discovered in fuyan cave of dao county hunan the larger animals which lived alongside these humans include the extinct ailuropoda baconi panda the crocuta ultima hyena the stegodon and the giant tapir evidence of middle palaeolithic levallois technology has been found in the lithic assemblage of guanyindong cave site in southwest china dated to approximately  years ago neolithic the neolithic age in china is considered to have begun about  years ago because the neolithic is conventionally defined by the presence of agriculture it follows that the neolithic began at different times in the various regions of what is now china agriculture in china developed gradually with initial domestication of a few grains and animals gradually expanding with the addition of many others over subsequent millennia the earliest evidence of cultivated rice found by the yangtze river was carbondated to  years ago early evidence for millet agriculture in the yellow river valley was radiocarbondated to about  bc the jiahu site is one of the best preserved early agricultural villages  to  bc at damaidi in ningxia  cliff carvings dating to  bc have been discovered featuring  individual characters such as the sun moon stars gods and scenes of hunting or grazing according to researcher

believed to be the site of a major ancient city of a previously unknown bronze age culture between  and  bc the site was first discovered in  and then rediscovered in  chinese archaeologists have identified the sanxingdui culture to be part of the state of shu linking the artifacts found at the site to its early legendary kings the graves at mogou revealed a high level of violence in the qijia culture ferrous metallurgy begins to appear in the late th century in the yangtze valley a bronze hatchet with a blade of meteoric iron excavated near the city of gaocheng in shijiazhuang now hebei has been dated to the th century bc an iron age culture of the tibetan plateau has tentatively been associated with the zhang zhung culture described in early tibetan writings ancient china chinese historians in later periods were accustomed to the notion of one dynasty succeeding another but the political situation in early china was much more complicated hence as some scholars of china suggest the xia and the shang can refer to political entities that existed concurrently just as the early zhou existed at the same time as the shang this bears similarities to how china both contemporaneously and later has been divided into states that were not one region legally or culturally the earliest period once considered historical was the legendary era of the sageemperors yao shun and yu traditionally the abdication system was prominent in this period with yao yielding his throne to shun who abdicated to yu who founded the xia dynasty xia dynasty c   c  bc the xia dynasty c   c  bc is the earliest of the three dynasties described in much later traditional historiography which includes the bamboo annals and sima qians shiji c  bc the xia is generally considered mythical by western scholars but in china it is usually associated with the early bronze age site at erlitou  bc in henan that was excavated in  since no writing was excavated at erlitou or any other contemporaneous site there is not enough evidence to prove whether the xia dynasty ever existed some archaeologists claim that the erlitou site was the capital of the xia in any case the site of erlitou had a level of political organization that would not be incompatible with the legends of xia recorded in later texts more importantly the erlitou site has the earliest evidence for an elite who conducted rituals using cast bronze vessels which would later be adopted by the shang and zhou shang dynasty c   c  bc both archaeological evidence like oracle bones and bronzes as well as transmitted texts attest the historical existence of the shang dynasty c   c  bc findings from the earlier shang period come from excavations at erligang modern zhengzhou findings have been found at yinxu near modern anyang henan the site of the final shang capital during the late shang period c  bc the findings at anyang include the earliest written record of the chinese so far discovered inscriptions of divination records in ancient chinese writing on the bones or shells of animalsthe oracle bones dating from c   c  bc a series of at least twentynine kings reigned over the shang dynasty throughout their reigns according to the shiji the capital city was moved six times the final and most important move was to yin during the reign of wu ding c  bc the term yin dynasty has been synonymous with the shang dynasty in history although it has lately been used to refer specifically to the latter half of the shang dynasty although written records found at anyang confirm the existence of the shang dynasty western scholars are often hesitant to associate settlements that are contemporaneous with the anyang settlement with the shang dynasty for example archaeological findings at sanxingdui suggest a technologically advanced civilization culturally unlike anyang the evidence is inconclusive in proving how far the shang realm extended from anyang the leading hypothesis is that anyang ruled by the same shang in the official history coexisted and traded with numerous other culturally diverse settlements in the area that is now referred to as china proper zhou dynasty  bc the zhou dynasty  bc to about  bc is the longestlasting dynasty in chinese history though its power declined steadily over the almost eight centuries of its existence in the late nd millennium bc the zhou dynasty arose in the wei river valley of modern western shaanxi province where they were appointed western protectors by the shang a coalition led by the ruler of the zhou king wu defeated the shang at the battle of muye they took over most of the central and lower yellow river valley and enfeoffed their relatives and allies in semiindependent states across the region several of these states eventually became more powerful than the zhou kings the kings of zhou invoked the concept of the mandate of heaven to legitimize their rule a concept that was influential for almost every succeeding dynasty like shangdi heaven tian ruled over all the other gods and it decided who would rule china it was believed that a ruler lost the mandate of heaven when natural disasters occurred in great number and when more realistically the sovereign had apparently lost his concern for the people in response the royal house would be overthrown and a new house would rule having been granted the mandate of heaven the zhou established two capitals zongzhou near modern xian and chengzhou luoyang with the kings court moving between them regularly the zhou alliance gradually expanded eastward into shandong southeastward into the huai river valley and southward into the yangtze river valley spring and autumn period  bc in  bc king you and his forces were defeated in the battle of mount li by rebel states and quanrong barbarians the rebel aristocrats established a new ruler king ping in luoyang beginning the second major phase of the zhou dynasty the eastern zhou period which is divided into the spring and autumn and warring states periods the former period is named after the famous spring and autumn annals the sharply reduced political authority of the royal house left a power vacuum at the center of the zhou culture sphere the zhou kings had delegated local political authority to hundreds of settlement states some of them only as large as a walled town and surrounding land these states began to fight against one another and vie for hegemony the more powerful states tended to conquer and incorporate the weaker ones so the number of states declined over time by the th century bc most small states had disappeared by being annexed and just a few large and powerful principalities remained some southern states such as chu and wu claimed independence from the zhou who undertook wars against some of them wu and yue many new cities were established in this period and society gradually became more urbanized and commercialized many famous individuals such as laozi confucius and sun tzu lived during this chaotic period conflict in this period occurred both between and within states warfare between states forced the surviving states to develop better administrations to mobilize more soldiers and resources within states there was constant jockeying between elite families for example the three most powerful families in the jin statezhao wei and haneventually overthrew the ruling family and partitioned the state between them the hundred schools of thought of classical chinese philosophy began blossoming during this period and the subsequent warring states period such influential intellectual movements as confucianism taoism legalism and mohism were founded partly in response to the changing political world the first two philosophical thoughts would have an enormous influence on chinese culture warring states period  bc after further political consolidations seven prominent states remained during the th century bc the years in which these states battled each other is known as the warring states period though the zhou king nominally remained as such until  bc he was largely a figurehead that held little real power numerous developments were made during this period in the areas of culture and mathematicsincluding the zuo zhuan within the spring and autumn annals a literary work summarizing the preceding spring and autumn period and the bundle of  bamboo slips from the tsinghua collection dated to  bcbeing the worlds earliest known example of a twodigit base multiplication table the tsinghua collection indicates that sophisticated commercial arithmetic was already established during this period as neighboring territories of the seven states were annexed including areas of modern sichuan and liaoning they were now to be governed under an administrative system of commanderies and prefectures this system had been in use elsewhere since the spring and autumn period and its influence on administration would prove resilientits terminology can still be seen in the contemporaneous sheng and xian provinces and counties of contemporary china the state of qin became dominant in the waning decades of the warring states period conquering the shu capital of jinsha on the chengdu plain and then eventually driving chu from its place in the han river valley qin imitated the administrative reforms of the other states thereby becoming a powerhouse its final expansion began during the reign of ying zheng ultimately unifying the other six regional powers and enabling him to proclaim himself as chinas first emperorknown to history as qin shi huang imperial china early imperial china qin dynasty  bc ying zhengs establishment of the qin dynasty  in  bc effectively formalised the region as a true empire for the first time in chinese history rather than a state and its pivotal status probably led to qin  later evolving into the western term china to emphasise his sole rule zheng proclaimed himself shi huangdi  first emperor the huangdi title derived from chinese mythology became the standard for subsequent rulers based in xianyang the empire was a centralized bureaucratic monarchy a governing scheme which dominated the future of imperial china in an effort to improve the zhous perceived failures this system consisted of more than  commanderies  jun made up of counties  xian and progressively smaller divisions each with a local leader many aspects of society were informed by legalism a state ideology promoted by the emperor and his chancellor li si that was introduced at an earlier time by shang yang in legal matters this philosophy emphasised mutual responsibility in disputes and severe punishments for crime while economic practices included the general encouragement of agriculture and repression of trade reforms occurred in weights and measures writing styles seal script and metal currency ban liang all of which were standardized traditionally qin shi huang is regarded as ordering a mass burning of books and the live burial of scholars under the guise of legalism though contemporary scholars express considerable doubt on the historicity of this event despite its importance legalism was probably supplemented in nonpolitical matters by confucianism for social and moral beliefs and the fiveelement wuxing  theories for cosmological thought the qin administration kept exhaustive records on their population collecting information on their sex age social status and residence commoners who made up over  of the population suffered harsh treatment according to the historian patricia buckley ebrey as they were often conscripted into forced labor for the empires construction projects this included a massive system of imperial highways in  bc which ranged around  miles  km altogether other major construction projects were assigned to the general meng tian who concurrently led a successful campaign against the northern xiongnu peoples s bc reportedly with  troops under qin shi huangs orders meng supervised the combining of numerous ancient walls into what came to be known as the great wall of china and oversaw the building of a  miles  km straight highway between northern and southern china the emperor also oversaw the construction of his monumental mausoleum which includes the well known terracotta army after qin shi huangs death the qin government drastically deteriorated and eventually capitulated in  bc after the qin capital was captured and sacked by rebels which would ultimately lead to the establishment of the han empire han dynasty  bc  ad  western han the han dynasty was founded by liu bang who emerged victorious in the chuhan contention that followed the fall of the qin dynasty a golden age in chinese history the han dynastys long period of stability and prosperity consolidated the foundation of china as a unified state under a central imperial bureaucracy which was to last intermittently for most of the next two millennia during the han dynasty territory of china was extended to most of the china proper and to areas far west confucianism was officially elevated to orthodox status and was to shape the subsequent chinese civilization art culture and science all advanced to unprecedented heights with the profound and lasting impacts of this period of chinese history the dynasty name han had been taken as the name of the chinese people now the dominant ethnic group in modern china and had been commonly used to refer to chinese language and written characters after the initial laissezfaire policies of emperors wen and jing the ambitious emperor wu brought the empire to its zenith to consolidate his power he disenfranchised the majority of imperial relatives appointing military governors to control their former lands as a further step he extended patronage to confucianism which emphasizes stability and order in a wellstructured society imperial universities were established to support its study at the urging of his legalist advisors however he also strengthened the fiscal structure of the dynasty with government monopolies major military campaigns were launched to weaken the nomadic xiongnu empire limiting their influence north of the great wall along with the diplomatic efforts led by zhang qian the sphere of influence of the han empire extended to the states in the tarim basin opened up the silk road that connected china to the west stimulating bilateral trade and cultural exchange to the south various small kingdoms far beyond the yangtze river valley were formally incorporated into the empire emperor wu also dispatched a series of military campaigns against the baiyue tribes the han annexed minyue in  bc and  bc nanyue in  bc and dian in  bc migration and military expeditions led to the cultural assimilation of the south it also brought the han into contact with kingdoms in southeast asia introducing diplomacy and trade after emperor wu the empire slipped into gradual stagnation and decline economically the state treasury was strained by excessive campaigns and projects while land acquisitions by elite families gradually drained the tax base various consort clans exerted increasing control over strings of incompetent emperors and eventually the dynasty was briefly interrupted by the usurpation of wang mang xin dynasty in ad  the usurper wang mang claimed that the mandate of heaven called for the end of the han dynasty and the rise of his own and he founded the shortlived xin dynasty wang mang started an extensive program of land and other economic reforms including the outlawing of slavery and land nationalization and redistribution these programs however were never supported by the landholding families because they favored the peasants the instability of power brought about chaos uprisings and loss of territories this was compounded by mass flooding of the yellow river silt buildup caused it to split into two channels and displaced large numbers of farmers wang mang was eventually killed in weiyang palace by an enraged peasant mob in ad  eastern han emperor guangwu reinstated the han dynasty with the support of landholding and merchant families at luoyang east of the former capital xian thus this new era is termed the eastern han dynasty with the capable administrations of emperors ming and zhang former glories of the dynasty were reclaimed with brilliant military and cultural achievements the xiongnu empire was decisively defeated the diplomat and general ban chao further expanded the conquests across the pamirs to the shores of the caspian sea thus reopening the silk road and bringing trade foreign cultures along with the arrival of buddhism with extensive connections with the west the first of several roman embassies to china were recorded in chinese sources coming from the sea route in ad  and a second one in ad  the eastern han dynasty was one of the most prolific eras of science and technology in ancient china notably the historic invention of papermaking by cai lun and the numerous scientific and mathematical contributions by the famous polymath zhang heng six dynasties three kingdoms ad  by the nd century the empire declined amidst land acquisitions invasions and feuding between consort clans and eunuchs the yellow turban rebellion broke out in ad  ushering in an era of warlords in the ensuing turmoil three states emerged trying to gain predominance and reunify the land giving this historical period its name the classic historical novel romance of the three kingdoms dramatizes events of this period the warlord cao cao reunified the north in  and in  his son accepted the abdication of emperor xian of han thus initiating the wei dynasty soon weis rivals shu and wu proclaimed their independence this period was characterized by a gradual decentralization of the state that had existed during the qin and han dynasties and an increase in the power of great families in  the jin dynasty overthrew the wei and later unified the country in  but this union was shortlived jin dynasty ad  the jin dynasty reunited china proper for the first time since the end of the han dynasty ending the three kingdoms era however the jin dynasty was severely weakened by the war of the eight princes and lost control of northern china after nonhan chinese settlers rebelled and captured luoyang and changan in  the jin prince sima rui based in modernday nanjing became emperor and continued the dynasty now known as the eastern jin which held southern china for another century prior to this move historians refer to the jin dynasty as the western jin sixteen kingdoms ad  northern china fragmented into a series of independent states known as the sixteen kingdoms most of which were founded by xiongnu xianbei jie di and qiang rulers these nonhan peoples were ancestors of the turks mongols and tibetans many had to some extent been sinicized long before their ascent to power in fact some of them notably the qiang and the xiongnu had already been allowed to live in the frontier regions within the great wall since late han times during this period warfare ravaged the north and prompted largescale han chinese migration south to the yangtze river basin and delta northern and southern dynasties ad  in the early th century china entered a period known as the northern and southern dynasties in which parallel regimes ruled the northern and southern halves of the country in the south the eastern jin gave way to the liu song southern qi liang and finally chen each of these southern dynasties were led by han chinese ruling families and used jiankang modern nanjing as the capital they held off attacks from the north and preserved many aspects of chinese civilization while northern barbarian regimes began to sinify in the north the last of the sixteen kingdoms was extinguished in  by the northern wei a kingdom founded by the xianbei a nomadic people who unified northern china the northern wei eventually split into the eastern and western wei which then became the northern qi and northern zhou these regimes were dominated by xianbei or han chinese who had married into xianbei families during this period most xianbei people adopted han surnames eventually leading to complete assimilation into the han despite the division of the country buddhism spread throughout the land in southern china fierce debates about whether buddhism should be allowed were held frequently by the royal court and nobles by the end of the era buddhists and taoists had become much more tolerant of each other midimperial china sui dynasty  the shortlived sui dynasty was a pivotal period in chinese history founded by emperor wen in  in succession of the northern zhou the sui went on to conquer the southern chen in  to reunify china ending three centuries of political division the sui pioneered many new institutions including the government system of three departments and six ministries imperial examinations for selecting officials from commoners while improved on the systems of fubing system of the army conscription and the equalfield system of land distributions these policies which were adopted by later dynasties brought enormous population growth and amassed excessive wealth to the state standardized coinage was enforced throughout the unified empire buddhism took root as a prominent religion and was supported officially sui china was known for its numerous megaconstruction projects intended for grains shipment and transporting troops the grand canal was constructed linking the capitals daxing changan and luoyang to the wealthy southeast region and in another route to the northeast border the great wall was also expanded while series of military conquests and diplomatic maneuvers further pacified its borders however the massive invasions of the korean peninsula during the goguryeosui war failed disastrously triggering widespread revolts that led to the fall of the dynasty tang dynasty  the tang dynasty was a golden age of chinese civilization a prosperous stable and creative period with significant developments in culture art literature particularly poetry and technology buddhism became the predominant religion for the common people changan modern xian the national capital was the largest city in the world during its time the first emperor emperor gaozu came to the throne on  june  placed there by his son li shimin who became the second emperor taizong one of the greatest emperors in chinese history combined military conquests and diplomatic maneuvers reduced threats from central asian tribes extended the border and brought neighboring states into a tributary system military victories in the tarim basin kept the silk road open connecting changan to central asia and areas far to the west in the south lucrative maritime trade routes from port cities such as guangzhou connected with distant countries and foreign merchants settled in china encouraging a cosmopolitan culture the tang culture and social systems were observed and adapted by neighboring countries most notably japan internally the grand canal linked the political heartland in changan to the agricultural and economic centers in the eastern and southern parts of the empire xuanzang a chinese buddhist monk scholar traveller and translator travelled to india on his own and returned with over six hundred mahayana and hinayana texts seven statues of the buddha and more than a hundred sarira relics the prosperity of the early tang dynasty was abetted by a centralized bureaucracy the government was organized as three departments and six ministries to separately draft review and implement policies these departments were run by royal family members and landed aristocrats but as the dynasty wore on were joined or replaced by scholar officials selected by imperial examinations setting patterns for later dynasties under the tang equalfield system all land was owned by the emperor and granted to each family according to household size men granted land were conscripted for military service for a fixed period each year a military policy known as the fubing system these policies stimulated a rapid growth in productivity and a significant army without much burden on the state treasury by the dynastys midpoint however standing armies had replaced conscription and land was continuously falling into the hands of private owners and religious institutions granted exemptions the dynasty continued to flourish under the rule of empress wu zetian the only official empress regnant in chinese history and reached its zenith during the long reign of emperor xuanzong who oversaw an empire that stretched from the pacific to the aral sea with at least  million people there were vibrant artistic and cultural creations including works of the greatest chinese poets li bai and du fu at the zenith of prosperity of the empire the an lushan rebellion from  to  was a watershed event war disease and economic disruption devastated the population and drastically weakened the central imperial government upon suppression of the rebellion regional military governors known as jiedushi gained increasingly autonomous status as the central government lost its ability to control them with loss of revenue from land tax the central imperial government came to rely heavily on its salt monopoly externally former submissive states raided the empire and the vast border territories were lost for centuries nevertheless civil society recovered and thrived amidst the weakened imperial bureaucracy in late tang period the empire was worn out by recurring revolts of the regional military governors while scholarofficials engaged in fierce factional strife and corrupted eunuchs amassed immense power catastrophically the huang chao rebellion from  to  devastated the entire empire for a decade the sack of the southern port guangzhou in  was followed by the massacre of most of its inhabitants especially the large foreign merchant enclaves by  both capitals luoyang and changan fell successively the reliance on ethnic han and turkic warlords in suppressing the rebellion increased their power and influence consequently the fall of the dynasty following zhu wens usurpation led to an era of division in   shatuo under zhuye jinzhong defected from the tibetans to tang china and the tibetans punished them by killing zhuye jinzhong as they were chasing them the uyghurs also fought against an alliance of shatuo and tibetans at beshbalik the shatuo turks under zhuye chixin li guochang served the tang dynasty in fighting against their fellow turkic people in the uyghur khaganate in  when the uyghur khaganate huigu general jueluowu  rose against the rule of thenreigning zhangxin khan he elicited the help from zhuye chixin by giving zhuye  horses and together they defeated zhangxin khan who then committed suicide precipitating the subsequent collapse of the uyghur khaganate in the next few years when uyghur khaganate remnants tried to raid tang borders the shatuo participated extensively in counterattacking the uyghur khaganate with other tribes loyal to tang in  zhuye chixin under the command of the han chinese officer shi xiong with tuyuhun tangut and han chinese troops participated in a raid against the uyghur khaganate that led to the slaughter of uyghur forces at shahu mountain five dynasties and ten kingdoms  the period of political disunity between the tang and the song known as the five dynasties and ten kingdoms period lasted from  to  during this halfcentury china was in all respects a multistate system five regimes namely later liang tang jin han and zhou rapidly succeeded one another in control of the traditional imperial heartland in northern china among the regimes rulers of later tang jin and han were sinicized shatuo turks which ruled over an ethnic majority of han chinese in the north more stable and smaller regimes of mostly ethnic han rulers coexisted in south and western china over the period cumulatively constituted the ten kingdoms amidst political chaos in the north the strategic sixteen prefectures region along todays great wall were ceded to the emerging khitan liao dynasty which drastically weakened the defense of china proper against northern nomadic empires to the south vietnam gained lasting independence after being a chinese prefecture for many centuries with wars dominating in northern china there were mass southward migrations of population which further enhanced the southward shift of cultural and economic centers in china the era ended with the coup of later zhou general zhao kuangyin and the establishment of the song dynasty in  which eventually annihilated the remains of the ten kingdoms and reunified china late imperial china song liao jin and western xia dynasties  in  the song dynasty was founded by emperor taizu with its capital established in kaifeng then known as bianjing in  the song dynasty reunified most of china proper while large swaths of the outer territories were occupied by sinicized nomadic empires the khitan liao dynasty which lasted from  to  ruled over manchuria mongolia and parts of northern china meanwhile in what are now the northwestern chinese provinces of gansu shaanxi and ningxia the tangut tribes founded the western xia dynasty from  to  aiming to recover the strategic sixteen prefectures lost in the previous dynasty campaigns were launched against the liao dynasty in the early song period which all ended in failure then in  the liao cavalry swept over the exposed north china plain and reached the outskirts of kaifeng forcing the songs submission and then agreement to the chanyuan treaty which imposed heavy annual tributes from the song treasury the treaty was a significant reversal of chinese dominance of the traditional tributary system yet the annual outflow of songs silver to the liao was paid back through the purchase of chinese goods and products which expanded the song economy and replenished its treasury this dampened the incentive for the song to further campaign against the liao meanwhile this crossborder trade and contact induced further sinicization within the liao empire at the expense of its military might which was derived from its nomadic lifestyle similar treaties and socialeconomical consequences occurred in songs relations with the jin dynasty within the liao empire the jurchen tribes revolted against their overlords to establish the jin dynasty in  in  the devastating jin cataphract annihilated the liao dynasty while remnants of liao court members fled to central asia to found the qara khitai empire western liao dynasty jins invasion of the song dynasty followed swiftly in  kaifeng was sacked a massive catastrophe known as the jingkang incident ending the northern song dynasty later the entire north of china was conquered the surviving members of the song court regrouped in the new capital city of hangzhou and initiated the southern song dynasty which ruled territories south of the huai river in the ensuing years the territory and population of china were divided between the song dynasty the jin dynasty and the western xia dynasty the era ended with the mongol conquest as western xia fell in  the jin dynasty in  and finally the southern song dynasty in  despite its military weakness the song dynasty is widely considered to be the high point of classical chinese civilization the song economy facilitated by technological advancement had reached a level of sophistication probably unseen in world history before its time the population soared to over  million and the living standards of common people improved tremendously due to improvements in rice cultivation and the wide availability of coal for production the capital cities of kaifeng and subsequently hangzhou were both the most populous cities in the world for their time and encouraged vibrant civil societies unmatched by previous chinese dynasties although land trading routes to the far west were blocked by nomadic empires there was extensive maritime trade with neighbouring states such as in southeast asia which facilitated the use of song coinage as the de facto currency of exchange giant wooden vessels equipped with compasses traveled throughout the china seas and northern indian ocean the concept of insurance was practised by merchants to hedge the risks of such longhaul maritime shipments with prosperous economic activities the historically first use of paper currency emerged in the western city of chengdu as a cheaper supplement to the existing copper coins the song dynasty was considered to be the golden age of great advancements in science and technology of china thanks to innovative scholarofficials such as su song  and shen kuo  inventions such as the hydromechanical astronomical clock the first continuous and endless powertransmitting chain woodblock printing and paper money were all invented during the song dynasty further cementing its status there was court intrigue between the political reformers and conservatives led by the chancellors wang anshi and sima guang respectively by the midtolate th century the chinese had adopted the dogma of neoconfucian philosophy formulated by zhu xi enormous literary works were compiled during the song dynasty such as the innovative historical narrative zizhi tongjian comprehensive mirror to aid in government the invention of movabletype printing further facilitated the spread of knowledge culture and the arts flourished with grandiose artworks such as along the river during the qingming festival and eighteen songs of a nomad flute along with great buddhist painters such as the prolific lin tinggui the song dynasty was also a period of major innovation in the history of warfare gunpowder while invented in the tang dynasty was first put into practical use on the battlefield by the song army inspiring a succession of new firearms and siege engines designs during the southern song dynasty as its survival hinged decisively on guarding the yangtze and huai river against the cavalry forces from the north the first standing navy in china was assembled in  with its admirals headquarters established at dinghai paddlewheel warships equipped with trebuchets could launch incendiary bombs made of gunpowder and lime to effect as recorded in songs victory over the invading jin forces at the battle of tangdao in the east china sea and the battle of caishi on the yangtze river in  the advances in civilisation during the song dynasty came to an abrupt end following the devastating mongol conquest of the north and subsequently other areas of the empire during which the population sharply dwindled with a marked contraction in economy despite viciously halting mongol advances for more than three decades the southern song capital hangzhou fell in  followed by the final annihilation of the song standing navy at the battle of yamen in  yuan dynasty  the yuan dynasty was formally proclaimed in  when the great khan of mongol kublai khan one of the grandsons of genghis khan assumed the additional title of emperor of china and considered his inherited part of the mongol empire as a chinese dynasty in the preceding decades the mongols had conquered the jin dynasty in northern china and the southern song dynasty fell in  after a protracted and bloody war the mongol yuan dynasty became the first conquest dynasty in chinese history to rule the entirety of china proper and its population as an ethnic minority the dynasty also directly controlled the mongol heartland and other regions inheriting the largest share of territory of the eastern mongol empire which roughly coincided with the modern area of china and nearby regions in east asia further expansion of the empire was halted after defeats in the invasions of japan and vietnam following the previous jin dynasty the capital of yuan dynasty was established at khanbaliq also known as dadu modernday beijing the grand canal was reconstructed to connect the remote capital city to lively economic hubs in southern part of china setting the precedence and foundation for beijing to largely remain as the capital of the successive regimes of the unified chinese mainland a series of mongol civil wars in the late th century led to the division of the mongol empire in  the emperors of the yuan dynasty were upheld as the nominal khagan over western khanates the chagatai khanate the golden horde and the ilkhanate which nonetheless remained de facto autonomous the era was known as pax mongolica when much of the asian continent was ruled by the mongols for the first and only time in history the silk road was controlled entirely by a single state facilitating the flow of people trade and cultural exchange a network of roads and a postal system were established to connect the vast empire lucrative maritime trade developed from the previous song dynasty continued to flourish with quanzhou and hangzhou emerging as the largest ports in the world adventurous travelers from the far west most notably the venetian marco polo would settle in china for decades upon his return his detail travel record inspired generations of medieval europeans with the splendors of the far east the yuan dynasty was the first ancient economy where paper currency known at the time as jiaochao was used as the predominant medium of exchange its unrestricted issuance in the late yuan dynasty inflicted hyperinflation which eventually brought the downfall of the dynasty while the mongol rulers of the yuan dynasty adopted substantially to chinese culture their sinicization was of lesser extent compared to earlier conquest dynasties in chinese history for preserving racial superiority as the conqueror and ruling class traditional nomadic customs and heritage from the mongolian steppe were held in high regard on the other hand the mongol rulers also adopted flexibly to a variety of cultures from many advanced civilizations within the vast empire traditional social structure and culture in china underwent immense transform during the mongol dominance large groups of foreign migrants settled in china who enjoyed elevated social status over the majority han chinese while enriching chinese culture with foreign elements the class of scholar officials and intellectuals traditional bearers of elite chinese culture lost substantial social status this stimulated the development of culture of the common folks there were prolific works in zaju variety shows and literary songs sanqu which were written in a distinctive poetry style known as qu novels of vernacular style gained unprecedented status and popularity before the mongol invasion chinese dynasties reported approximately  million inhabitants after the conquest had been completed in  the  census reported roughly  million people this major decline is not necessarily due only to mongol killings scholars such as frederick w mote argue that the wide drop in numbers reflects an administrative failure to record rather than an actual decrease others such as timothy brook argue that the mongols created a system of enserfment among a huge portion of the chinese populace causing many to disappear from the census altogether other historians including william mcneill and david morgan consider that plague was the main factor behind the demographic decline during this period in the th century china suffered additional depredations from epidemics of plague estimated to have killed around a quarter of the population of china throughout the yuan dynasty there was some general sentiment among the populace against the mongol dominance yet rather than the nationalist cause it was mainly strings of natural disasters and incompetent corrupt governance that triggered widespread peasant uprisings since the s after the massive naval engagement at lake poyang zhu yuanzhang prevailed over other rebel forces in the south he proclaimed himself emperor and founded the ming dynasty in  the same year his northern expedition army captured the capital khanbaliq the yuan remnants fled back to mongolia and sustained the regime but the period of yuan dominance was effectively over for good other mongol khanates in central asia continued to exist after the fall of yuan dynasty in china ming dynasty  the ming dynasty was founded by zhu yuanzhang in  who proclaimed himself as the hongwu emperor the capital was initially set at nanjing and was later moved to beijing from yongle emperors reign onward urbanization increased as the population grew and as the division of labor grew more complex large urban centers such as nanjing and beijing also contributed to the growth of private industry in particular smallscale industries grew up often specializing in paper silk cotton and porcelain goods for the most part however relatively small urban centers with markets proliferated around the country town markets mainly traded food with some necessary manufactures such as pins or oil despite the xenophobia and intellectual introspection characteristic of the increasingly popular new school of neoconfucianism china under the early ming dynasty was not isolated foreign trade and other contacts with the outside world particularly japan increased considerably chinese merchants explored all of the indian ocean reaching east africa with the voyages of zheng he the hongwu emperor being the only founder of a chinese dynasty who was also of peasant origin had laid the foundation of a state that relied fundamentally in agriculture commerce and trade which flourished in the previous song and yuan dynasties were less emphasized neofeudal landholdings of the song and mongol periods were expropriated by the ming rulers land estates were confiscated by the government fragmented and rented out private slavery was forbidden consequently after the death of the yongle emperor independent peasant landholders predominated in chinese agriculture these laws might have paved the way to removing the worst of the poverty during the previous regimes towards later era of the ming dynasty with declining government control commerce trade and private industries revived the dynasty had a strong and complex central government that unified and controlled the empire the emperors role became more autocratic although hongwu emperor necessarily continued to use what he called the grand secretariat to assist with the immense paperwork of the bureaucracy including memorials petitions and recommendations to the throne imperial edicts in reply reports of various kinds and tax records it was this same bureaucracy that later prevented the ming government from being able to adapt to changes in society and eventually led to its decline the yongle emperor strenuously tried to extend chinas influence beyond its borders by demanding other rulers send ambassadors to china to present tribute a large navy was built including fourmasted ships displacing  tons a standing army of  million troops was created the chinese armies conquered and occupied vietnam for around  years while the chinese fleet sailed the china seas and the indian ocean cruising as far as the east coast of africa the chinese gained influence in eastern moghulistan several maritime asian nations sent envoys with tribute for the chinese emperor domestically the grand canal was expanded and became a stimulus to domestic trade over  tons of iron per year were produced many books were printed using movable type the imperial palace in beijings forbidden city reached its current splendor it was also during these centuries that the potential of south china came to be fully exploited new crops were widely cultivated and industries such as those producing porcelain and textiles flourished in  esen tayisi led an oirat mongol invasion of northern china which culminated in the capture of the zhengtong emperor at tumu since then the ming became on the defensive on the northern frontier which led to the ming great wall being built most of what remains of the great wall of china today was either built or repaired by the ming the brick and granite work was enlarged the watchtowers were redesigned and cannons were placed along its length at sea the ming became increasingly isolationist after the death of the yongle emperor the treasure voyages which sailed the indian ocean were discontinued and the maritime prohibition laws were set in place banning the chinese from sailing abroad european traders who reached china in the midst of the age of discovery were repeatedly rebuked in their requests for trade with the portuguese being repulsed by the ming navy at tuen mun in  and again in  domestic and foreign demands for overseas trade deemed illegal by the state led to widespread wokou piracy attacking the southeastern coastline during the rule of the jiajing emperor  which only subsided after the opening of ports in guangdong and fujian and much military suppression in addition to raids from japan by the wokou raids from taiwan and the philippines by the pisheye also ravaged the southern coasts the portuguese were allowed to settle in macau in  for trade which remained in portuguese hands until  after the spanish invasion of the philippines trade with the spanish at manila imported large quantities of mexican and peruvian silver from the spanish americas to china the dutch entry into the chinese seas was also met with fierce resistance with the dutch being chased off the penghu islands in the sinodutch conflicts of  and were forced to settle in taiwan instead the dutch in taiwan fought with the ming in the battle of liaoluo bay in  and lost and eventually surrendered to the ming loyalist koxinga in  after the fall of the ming dynasty in  during the rule of the jiajing emperor the shaanxi earthquake killed about  people the deadliest earthquake of all time the ming dynasty intervened deeply in the japanese invasions of korea  which ended with the withdrawal of all invading japanese forces in korea and the restoration of the joseon dynasty its traditional ally and tributary state the regional hegemony of the ming dynasty was preserved at a toll on its resources coincidentally with mings control in manchuria in decline the manchu jurchen tribes under their chieftain nurhaci broke away from mings rule and emerged as a powerful unified state which was later proclaimed as the qing dynasty it went on to subdue the much weakened korea as its tributary conquered mongolia and expanded its territory to the outskirt of the great wall the most elite army of the ming dynasty was to station at the shanhai pass to guard the last stronghold against the manchus which weakened its suppression of internal peasants uprisings qing dynasty  the qing dynasty  was the last imperial dynasty in china founded by the manchus it was the second conquest dynasty to rule the entirety of china proper and roughly doubled the territory controlled by the ming the manchus were formerly known as jurchens residing in the northeastern part of the ming territory outside the great wall they emerged as the major threat to the late ming dynasty after nurhaci united all jurchen tribes and his son hong taiji declared the founding of the qing dynasty in  the qing dynasty set up the eight banners system that provided the basic framework for the qing military conquest li zichengs peasant rebellion captured beijing in  and the chongzhen emperor the last ming emperor committed suicide the manchus allied with the ming general wu sangui to seize beijing which was made the capital of the qing dynasty and then proceeded to subdue the ming remnants in the south during the mingqing transition when the ming dynasty and later the southern ming the emerging qing dynasty and several other factions like the shun dynasty and xi dynasty founded by peasant revolt leaders fought against each another which along with innumerable natural disasters at that time such as those caused by the little ice age and epidemics like the great plague during the last decade of the ming dynasty caused enormous loss of lives and significant harm to the economy in total these decades saw the loss of as many as  million lives but the qing appeared to have restored chinas imperial power and inaugurate another flowering of the arts the early manchu emperors combined traditions of inner asian rule with confucian norms of traditional chinese government and were considered a chinese dynasty the manchus enforced a queue order forcing han chinese men to adopt the manchu queue hairstyle officials were required to wear manchustyle clothing changshan bannermen dress and tangzhuang but ordinary han civilians were allowed to wear traditional han clothing bannermen could not undertake trade or manual labor they had to petition to be removed from banner status they were considered aristocracy and were given annual pensions land and allotments of cloth the kangxi emperor ordered the creation of the kangxi dictionary the most complete dictionary of chinese characters that had been compiled over the next halfcentury all areas previously under the ming dynasty were consolidated under the qing conquests in central asia in the eighteenth century extended territorial control between  and  the kangxi emperor suppressed the revolt of the three feudatories an uprising of three generals in southern china who had been denied hereditary rule of large fiefdoms granted by the previous emperor in  the qing staged an amphibious assault on southern taiwan bringing down the rebel kingdom of tungning which was founded by the ming loyalist koxinga zheng chenggong in  after the fall of the southern ming and had served as a base for continued ming resistance in southern china the qing defeated the russians at albazin resulting in the treaty of nerchinsk by the end of qianlong emperors long reign in  the qing empire was at its zenith the qing ruled more than onethird of the worlds population and had the largest economy in the world by area it was one of the largest empires ever in the th century the empire was internally restive and externally threatened by western powers the defeat by the british empire in the first opium war  led to the treaty of nanking  under which hong kong was ceded to britain and importation of opium produced by british empire territories was allowed opium usage continued to grow in china adversely affecting societal stability subsequent military defeats and unequal treaties with other western powers continued even after the fall of the qing dynasty internally the taiping rebellion  a christian religious movement led by the heavenly king hong xiuquan swept from the south to establish the taiping heavenly kingdom and controlled roughly a third of china proper for over a decade the court in desperation empowered han chinese officials such as zeng guofan to raise local armies after initial defeats zeng crushed the rebels in the third battle of nanking in  this was one of the largest wars in the th century in troop involvement there was massive loss of life with a death toll of about  million a string of civil disturbances followed including the puntihakka clan wars nian rebellion dungan revolt and panthay rebellion all rebellions were ultimately put down but at enormous cost and with millions dead seriously weakening the central imperial authority china never rebuilt a strong central army and many local officials used their military power to effectively rule independently in their provinces yet the dynasty appeared to recover in the tongzhi restoration  led by manchu royal family reformers and han chinese officials such as zeng guofan and his proteges li hongzhang and zuo zongtang their selfstrengthening movement made effective institutional reforms imported western factories and communications technology with prime emphasis on strengthening the military however the reform was undermined by official rivalries cynicism and quarrels within the imperial family the defeat of yuan shikais modernized beiyang fleet in the first sinojapanese war  led to the formation of the new army the guangxu emperor advised by kang youwei then launched a comprehensive reform effort the hundred days reform  empress dowager cixi however feared that precipitous change would lead to bureaucratic opposition and foreign intervention and quickly suppressed it in the summer of  the boxer uprising opposed foreign influence and murdered chinese christians and foreign missionaries when boxers entered beijing the qing government ordered all foreigners to leave but they and many chinese christians were besieged in the foreign legations quarter an eightnation alliance sent the seymour expedition of japanese russian british italian german french american and austrian troops to relieve the siege but they were routed and forced to retreat by boxer and qing troops at the battle of langfang after the alliances attack on the dagu forts the court declared war on the alliance and authorised the boxers to join with imperial armies after fierce fighting at tianjin the alliance formed the second much larger gaselee expedition and finally reached beijing the empress dowager evacuated to xian the boxer protocol ended the war exacting a tremendous indemnity the qing court then instituted administrative and legal reforms known as the late qing reforms including abolition of the examination system but young officials military officers and students debated reform perhaps a constitutional monarchy or the overthrow of the dynasty and the creation of a republic they were inspired by an emerging public opinion formed by intellectuals such as liang qichao and the revolutionary ideas of sun yatsen a localised military uprising the wuchang uprising began on  october  in wuchang today part of wuhan and soon spread the republic of china was proclaimed on  january  ending  years of dynastic rule modern period republic of china since  the provisional government of the republic of china was formed in nanjing on  march  sun yatsen became president of the republic of china but he turned power over to yuan shikai who commanded the new army over the next few years yuan proceeded to abolish the national and provincial assemblies and declared himself as the emperor of empire of china in late  in the style of an absolute monarchy yuans imperial ambitions were fiercely opposed by his subordinates faced with the rapidly growing prospect of violent rebellion he abdicated in march  and died of natural causes in june yuans death in  left a power vacuum the republican government that had been nearly brought to its knees by his policies was all but shattered this opened the way for the warlord era during which much of china was ruled by shifting coalitions of competing provincial military leaders and the beiyang government ushering in a shortlived period of uncertainty intellectuals disappointed in the failure of the republic launched the new culture movement in  the may fourth movement began as a response to the projapanese terms imposed on china by the treaty of versailles following world war i it quickly became a nationwide protest movement the protests were a moral success as the cabinet fell and china refused to sign the treaty of versailles which had awarded german holdings of shandong to japan memory of the mistreatment at versailles fuels resentment into the st century political and intellectual ferment waxed strong throughout the s and s according to patricia ebrey nationalism patriotism progress science democracy and freedom were the goals imperialism feudalism warlordism autocracy patriarchy and blind adherence to tradition were the enemies intellectuals struggled with how to be strong and modern and yet chinese how to preserve china as a political entity in the world of competing nations in the s sun yatsen established a revolutionary base in guangzhou and set out to unite the fragmented nation he welcomed assistance from the soviet union itself fresh from lenins communist takeover and he entered into an alliance with the fledgling chinese communist party ccp after suns death from cancer in  one of his proteges chiang kaishek seized control of the nationalist party kmt and succeeded in bringing most of south and central china under its rule in the northern expedition  having defeated the warlords in the south and central china by military force chiang was able to secure the nominal allegiance of the warlords in the north and establish the nationalist government in nanjing in  chiang turned on the ccp and relentlessly purged the communists elements in his nra in  driven from their mountain bases such as the chinese soviet republic the ccp forces embarked on the long march across chinas most desolate terrain to the northwest a feat transformed into legend where they established a guerrilla base at yanan in shaanxi during the long march the communists reorganised under a new leader mao zedong mao tsetung the bitter chinese civil war between the nationalists and the communists continued openly or clandestinely through the yearlong japanese occupation of various parts of the country  the two chinese parties nominally formed a united front to oppose the japanese in  during the second sinojapanese war  which became a part of world war ii although this alliance was tenuous at best and disagreements sometimes violent between the forces were still common japanese forces committed numerous war atrocities against the civilian population including biological warfare see unit  and the three alls policy sanko sakusen namely being kill all burn all and loot all during the war china was recognized as one of the allied big four in the declaration by united nations as a tribute to its enduring struggle against the invading japanese china was one of the four major allies of world war ii and was later considered one of the primary victors in the war following the defeat of japan in  the war between the nationalist government forces and the ccp resumed after failed attempts at reconciliation and a negotiated settlement by  the ccp had established control over most of the country odd arne westad says the communists won the civil war because they made fewer military mistakes than chiang and because in his search for a powerful centralized government chiang antagonised too many interest groups in china furthermore his party was weakened in the war against the japanese meanwhile the communists told different groups such as peasants exactly what they wanted to hear and cloaked themselves in the cover of chinese nationalism during the civil war both the nationalists and communists carried out mass atrocities with millions of noncombatants killed by both sides these included deaths from forced conscription and massacres the nationalists were slowly routed towards the south when the nationalist government forces were defeated by ccp forces in mainland china in  the nationalist government fled to taiwan with its forces along with chiang and a large number of their supporters the nationalist government had taken effective control of taiwan at the end of wwii as part of the overall japanese surrender when japanese troops in taiwan surrendered to the republic of china troops there until the early s the roc was recognised as the sole legitimate government of china by the united nations the united states and most western nations refusing to recognise the prc on account of its status as a communist nation during the cold war this changed in  when the prc was seated in the united nations replacing the roc the kmt ruled taiwan under martial law until  with the stated goal of being vigilant against communist infiltration and preparing to retake mainland china therefore political dissent was not tolerated during that period and crackdowns against dissidents were common in the s the roc underwent a major democratic reform beginning with the  resignation of the members of the legislative yuan and national assembly elected in  these groups were originally created to represent mainland china constituencies also lifted were the restrictions on the use of taiwanese languages in the broadcast media and in schools in  the roc held its first direct presidential election and the incumbent president kmt candidate lee tenghui was elected in  the kmt status as the ruling party ended when the dpp took power only to regain its status in the  election by ma yingjeou due to the controversial nature of taiwans political status the roc is currently recognised by merely  un member states and the holy see as of  as the legitimate government of china peoples republic of china since  major combat in the chinese civil war ended in  with the kmt pulling out of the mainland with the government relocating to taipei and maintaining control only over a few islands the ccp was left in control of mainland china on  october  mao zedong proclaimed the peoples republic of china communist china and red china were two common names for the prc the prc was shaped by a series of campaigns and fiveyear plans the great leap forward a radical campaign that encompassed numerous attempted economic and social reforms resulted in tens of millions of deaths maos government carried out mass executions of landowners instituted collectivisation and implemented the laogai camp system execution deaths from forced labor and other atrocities resulted in millions of deaths under mao in  mao and his allies launched the cultural revolution which continued until maos death a decade later the cultural revolution motivated by power struggles within the party and a fear of the soviet union led to a major upheaval in chinese society following the sinosoviet split and motivated by concerns of invasion by either the soviet union or the united states china initiated the third front campaign to develop national defense and industrial infrastructure in its rugged interior through its distribution of infrastructure industry and human capital around the country the third front created favorable conditions for subsequent market development and private enterprise in  at the peak of the sinosoviet split mao and zhou enlai met us president richard nixon in beijing to establish relations with the us in the same year the prc was admitted to the united nations in place of the republic of china with permanent membership of the security council a power struggle followed maos death in  the gang of four were arrested and blamed for the excesses of the cultural revolution marking the end of a turbulent political era in china deng xiaoping outmaneuvered maos anointed successor chairman hua guofeng and gradually emerged as the de facto leader over the next few years deng xiaoping was the paramount leader of china from  to  although he never became the head of the party or state and his influence within the party led the country to the reform and opening up the ccp subsequently loosened governmental control over citizens personal lives and the communes were disbanded with many peasants receiving multiple land leases which greatly increased incentives and agricultural production in addition there were many free market areas opened the most successful free market area was shenzhen it is located in guangdong and the property tax free area still exists today this turn of events marked chinas transition from a planned economy to a mixed economy with an increasingly open market environment a system termed by some as market socialism and officially by the ccp as socialism with chinese characteristics the prc adopted its current constitution on  december  in  the death of former general secretary hu yaobang helped to spark the tiananmen square protests of that year during which students and others campaigned for several months speaking out against corruption and in favour of greater political reform including democratic rights and freedom of speech however they were eventually put down on  june when army troops and vehicles entered and forcibly cleared the square resulting in considerable numbers of fatalities this event was widely reported and brought worldwide condemnation and sanctions against the communist government ccp general secretary and prc president jiang zemin and prc premier zhu rongji both former mayors of shanghai led posttiananmen prc in the s under jiang and zhus ten years of administration the prcs economic performance pulled an estimated  million peasants out of poverty and sustained an average annual gross domestic product growth rate of  the country formally joined the world trade organization in  by  and  former european colonies of british hong kong and portuguese macau became the hong kong and macau special administrative regions of the peoples republic of china respectively although the prc needed economic growth to spur its development the government began to worry that rapid economic growth was degrading the countrys natural resources and environment another concern was that certain sectors of society were not sufficiently benefiting from the prcs economic development one example of this was the wide gap between urban and rural areas in terms of development and prevalence of updated infrastructure as a result under former ccp general secretary and president hu jintao and premier wen jiabao the prc initiated policies to address issues of equitable distribution of resources but the outcome was not known as of  more than  million farmers were displaced from their land usually for economic development contributing to  demonstrations and riots across china in  for much of the prcs population living standards improved very substantially and freedom increased but political controls remained tight and rural areas poor since  the chinese government has been engaged in a harsh crackdown in xinjiang with around one million uyghurs and other ethnic and religion minorities being detained in internment camps aimed at changing the political thinking of detainees their identities and their religious beliefs in what some described as a genocide or crimes against humanity according to reports political indoctrination torture physical and psychological abuse forced sterilization sexual abuse and forced labor are common in these facilities the use of these centers appears to have ended in  following international pressure academic kerry brown attributes their closures beginning in late  to the expense required to operate them china has repeatedly denied this asserting that the west has never been able to produce reliablysourced satellite footage of any such detainment or resulting detention of minority groups although no comprehensive independent surveys of such centres have been performed as of june  spot checks by journalists have found such sites converted or abandoned in  amnesty international said that they were witnessing more and more arbitrary detention but that detained individuals were being moved from the camps into the formal prison system the novel coronavirus sarscov which causes
