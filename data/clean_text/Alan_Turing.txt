alan mathison turing   june    june  was an english mathematician computer scientist logician cryptanalyst philosopher and theoretical biologist he was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the turing machine which can be considered a model of a generalpurpose computer turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science born in london turing was raised in southern england he graduated from kings college cambridge and in  earned a doctorate degree from princeton university during world war ii turing worked for the government code and cypher school at bletchley park britains codebreaking centre that produced ultra intelligence he led hut  the section responsible for german naval cryptanalysis turing devised techniques for speeding the breaking of german ciphers including improvements to the prewar polish bomba method an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the enigma machine he played a crucial role in cracking intercepted messages that enabled the allies to defeat the axis powers in the battle of the atlantic and other engagements after the war turing worked at the national physical laboratory where he designed the automatic computing engine one of the first designs for a storedprogram computer in  turing joined max newmans computing machine laboratory at the university of manchester where he contributed to the development of early manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology turing wrote on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the belousovzhabotinsky reaction first observed in the s despite these accomplishments he was never fully recognised during his lifetime because much of his work was covered by the official secrets act in  turing was prosecuted for homosexual acts he accepted hormone treatment a procedure commonly referred to as chemical castration as an alternative to prison turing died on  june  aged  from cyanide poisoning an inquest determined his death as suicide but the evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning following a campaign in  british prime minister gordon brown made an official public apology for the appalling way turing was treated queen elizabeth ii granted a pardon in  the term alan turing law is used informally to refer to a  law in the uk that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts turing left an extensive legacy in mathematics and computing which has become widely recognised with statues and many things named after him including an annual award for computing innovation his portrait appears on the bank of england  note first released on  june  to coincide with his birthday the audience vote in a  bbc series named turing the greatest scientist of the th century the cognitive scientist douglas hofstadter writes atheist homosexual eccentric marathonrunning mathematician a m turing was in large part responsible not only for the concept of computers incisive theorems about their powers and a clear vision of the possibility of computer minds but also for the cracking of german ciphers during the second world war it is fair to say we owe much to alan turing for the fact that we are not under nazi rule today early life and education family turing was born in maida vale london while his father julius mathison turing was on leave from his position with the indian civil service ics of the british raj government at chatrapur then in the madras presidency and presently in odisha state in india turings father was the son of a clergyman the rev john robert turing from a scottish family of merchants that had been based in the netherlands and included a baronet turings mother juliuss wife was ethel sara turing nee stoney daughter of edward waller stoney chief engineer of the madras railways the stoneys were a protestant angloirish gentry family from both county tipperary and county longford while ethel herself had spent much of her childhood in county clare julius and ethel married on  october  at the church of ireland st bartholomews church on clyde road in ballsbridge dublin juliuss work with the ics brought the family to british india where his grandfather had been a general in the bengal army however both julius and ethel wanted their children to be brought up in britain so they moved to maida vale london where alan turing was born on  june  as recorded by a blue plaque on the outside of the house of his birth later the colonnade hotel turing had an elder brother john ferrier turing father of dermot turing th baronet of the turing baronets in  he discovered natural wonders every child should know by edwin tenney brewster he credited it with opening his eyes to science turings fathers civil service commission was still active during turings childhood years and his parents travelled between hastings in the united kingdom and india leaving their two sons to stay with a retired army couple at hastings turing stayed at baston lodge upper maze hill st leonardsonsea now marked with a blue plaque the plaque was unveiled on  june  the centenary of turings birth very early in life turings parents purchased a house in guildford in  and turing lived there during school holidays the location is also marked with a blue plaque school turings parents enrolled him at st michaels a primary school at  charles road st leonardsonsea from the age of six to nine the headmistress recognised his talent noting that she had clever boys and hardworking boys but alan is a genius between january  and  turing was educated at hazelhurst preparatory school an independent school in the village of frant in sussex now east sussex in  at the age of  he went on to sherborne school an independent boarding school in the market town of sherborne in dorset where he boarded at westcott house the first day of term coincided with the  general strike in britain but turing was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied  miles  km from southampton to sherborne stopping overnight at an inn turings natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at sherborne whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics his headmaster wrote to his parents i hope he will not fall between two stools if he is to stay at public school he must aim at becoming educated if he is to be solely a scientific specialist he is wasting his time at a public school despite this turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved solving advanced problems in  without having studied even elementary calculus in  aged  turing encountered albert einsteins work not only did he grasp it but it is possible that he managed to deduce einsteins questioning of newtons laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit christopher morcom at sherborne turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil christopher collan morcom  july    february  who has been described as turings first love their relationship provided inspiration in turings future endeavours but it was cut short by morcoms death in february  from complications of bovine tuberculosis contracted after drinking infected cows milk some years previously the event caused turing great sorrow he coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with morcom in a letter to morcoms mother frances isobel morcom nee swan turing wrote i am sure i could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited i regarded my interest in my work and in such things as astronomy to which he introduced me as something to be shared with him and i think he felt a little the same about me  i know i must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive because that is what he would like me to do turings relationship with morcoms mother continued long after morcoms death with her sending gifts to turing and him sending letters typically on morcoms birthday a day before the third anniversary of morcoms death  february  he wrote to mrs morcom i expect you will be thinking of chris when this reaches you i shall too and this letter is just to tell you that i shall be thinking of chris and of you tomorrow i am sure that he is as happy now as he was when he was here your affectionate alan some have speculated that morcoms death was the cause of turings atheism and materialism apparently at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit independent of the body and surviving death in a later letter also written to morcoms mother turing wrote personally i believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body  as regards the actual connection between spirit and body i consider that the body can hold on to a spirit whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected when the body is asleep i cannot guess what happens but when the body dies the mechanism of the body holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later perhaps immediately university and work on computability after graduating from sherborne turing applied for several cambridge colleges scholarships including trinity and kings eventually earning an  per annum scholarship equivalent to about  as of  to study at the latter there turing studied the undergraduate course in schedule b from february  to november  at kings college cambridge where he was awarded firstclass honours in mathematics his dissertation on the gaussian error function written during his senior year and delivered in november  proved a version of the central limit theorem it was finally accepted on  march  by spring of that same year turing started his masters course part iiiwhich he completed in and at the same time he published his first paper a onepage article called equivalence of left and right almost periodicity sent on  april featured in the tenth volume of the journal of the london mathematical society later that year turing was elected a fellow of kings college on the strength of his dissertation where he served as a lecturer however unknown to turing the version of the theorem he proved in his paper had already been proven by jarl waldemar lindeberg in  despite this the committee found turings methods original and so regarded the work worthy of consideration for the fellowship abram besicovitchs report for the committee went so far as to say that if turings work had been published before lindebergs it would have been an important event in the mathematical literature of that year between the springs of  and  at the same time as alonzo church turing worked on the decidability of problems starting from godels incompleteness theorems in midapril  turing sent max newman the first draft typescript of his investigations that same month church published his an unsolvable problem of elementary number theory with similar conclusions to turings thenyet unpublished work finally on  may of that year he finished and delivered his page paper for publication called on computable numbers with an application to the entscheidungsproblem it was published in the proceedings of the london mathematical society journal in two parts the first on  november and the second on  december in this paper turing reformulated kurt godels  results on the limits of proof and computation replacing godels universal arithmeticbased formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as turing machines the entscheidungsproblem decision problem was originally posed by german mathematician david hilbert in  turing proved that his universal computing machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm he went on to prove that there was no solution to the decision problem by first showing that the halting problem for turing machines is undecidable it is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a turing machine will ever halt this paper has been called easily the most influential math paper in history although turings proof was published shortly after churchs equivalent proof using his lambda calculus turings approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than churchs it also included a notion of a universal machine now known as a universal turing machine with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine as indeed could churchs lambda calculus according to the churchturing thesis turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable john von neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to turings paper to this day turing machines are a central object of study in theory of computation from september  to july  turing spent most of his time studying under church at princeton university in the second year as a jane eliza procter visiting fellow in addition to his purely mathematical work he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electromechanical binary multiplier in june  he obtained his phd from the department of mathematics at princeton his dissertation systems of logic based on ordinals introduced the concept of ordinal logic and the notion of relative computing in which turing machines are augmented with socalled oracles allowing the study of problems that cannot be solved by turing machines john von neumann wanted to hire him as his postdoctoral assistant but he went back to the united kingdom career and research when turing returned to cambridge he attended lectures given in  by ludwig wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics the lectures have been reconstructed verbatim including interjections from turing and other students from students notes turing and wittgenstein argued and disagreed with turing defending formalism and wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths but rather invents them cryptanalysis during the second world war turing was a leading participant in the breaking of german ciphers at bletchley park the historian and wartime codebreaker asa briggs has said you needed exceptional talent you needed genius at bletchley and turings was that genius from september  turing worked parttime with the government code and cypher school gccs the british codebreaking organisation he concentrated on cryptanalysis of the enigma cipher machine used by nazi germany together with dilly knox a senior gccs codebreaker soon after the july  meeting near warsaw at which the polish cipher bureau gave the british and french details of the wiring of enigma machines rotors and their method of decrypting enigma machines messages turing and knox developed a broader solution the polish method relied on an insecure indicator procedure that the germans were likely to change which they in fact did in may  turings approach was more general using cribbased decryption for which he produced the functional specification of the bombe an improvement on the polish bomba on  september  the day after the uk declared war on germany turing reported to bletchley park the wartime station of gccs like all others who came to bletchley he was required to sign the official secrets act in which he agreed not to disclose anything about his work at bletchley with severe legal penalties for violating the act specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that turing made during the war the others were deducing the indicator procedure used by the german navy developing a statistical procedure dubbed banburismus for making much more efficient use of the bombes developing a procedure dubbed turingery for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the lorenz sz  tunny cipher machine and towards the end of the war the development of a portable secure voice scrambler at hanslope park that was codenamed delilah by using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process turing made an innovative contribution to the subject he wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches titled the applications of probability to cryptography and paper on statistics of repetitions which were of such value to gccs and its successor gchq that they were not released to the uk national archives until april  shortly before the centenary of his birth a gchq mathematician who identified himself only as richard said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted under the official secrets act for some  years demonstrated their importance and their relevance to postwar cryptanalysis he said the fact that the contents had been restricted shows what a tremendous importance it has in the foundations of our subject  the papers detailed using mathematical analysis to try and determine which are the more likely settings so that they can be tried as quickly as possible  richard said that gchq had now squeezed the juice out of the two papers and was happy for them to be released into the public domain turing had a reputation for eccentricity at bletchley park he was known to his colleagues as prof and his treatise on enigma was known as the profs book according to historian ronald lewin jack good a cryptanalyst who worked with turing said of his colleague in the first week of june each year he would get a bad attack of hay fever and he would cycle to the office wearing a service gas mask to keep the pollen off his bicycle had a fault the chain would come off at regular intervals instead of having it mended he would count the number of times the pedals went round and would get off the bicycle in time to adjust the chain by hand another of his eccentricities is that he chained his mug to the radiator pipes to prevent it being stolen peter hilton recounted his experience working with turing in hut  in his reminiscences of bletchley park from a century of mathematics in america it is a rare experience to meet an authentic genius those of us privileged to inhabit the world of scholarship are familiar with the intellectual stimulation furnished by talented colleagues we can admire the ideas they share with us and are usually able to understand their source we may even often believe that we ourselves could have created such concepts and originated such thoughts however the experience of sharing the intellectual life of a genius is entirely different one realizes that one is in the presence of an intelligence a sensibility of such profundity and originality that one is filled with wonder and excitement alan turing was such a genius and those like myself who had the astonishing and unexpected opportunity created by the strange exigencies of the second world war to be able to count turing as colleague and friend will never forget that experience nor can we ever lose its immense benefit to us hilton echoed similar thoughts in the nova pbs documentary decoding nazi secrets while working at bletchley turing who was a talented longdistance runner occasionally ran the  miles  km to london when he was needed for meetings and he was capable of worldclass marathon standards turing tried out for the  british olympic team but he was hampered by an injury his tryout time for the marathon was only  minutes slower than british silver medallist thomas richards olympic race time of  hours  minutes he was walton athletic clubs best runner a fact discovered when he passed the group while running alone when asked why he ran so hard in training he replied i have such a stressful job that the only way i can get it out of my mind is by running hard its the only way i can get some release due to the challenges answering questions concerning what an outcome would have been if a historical event did or did not occur the realm of counterfactual history it is hard to estimate the precise effect ultra intelligence had on the war however official war historian harry hinsley estimated that this work shortened the war in europe by more than two years he added the caveat that this did not account for the use of the atomic bomb and other eventualities at the end of the war a memo was sent to all those who had worked at bletchley park reminding them that the code of silence dictated by the official secrets act did not end with the war but would continue indefinitely thus even though turing was appointed an officer of the order of the british empire obe in  by king george vi for his wartime services his work remained secret for many years bombe within weeks of arriving at bletchley park turing had specified an electromechanical machine called the bombe which could break enigma more effectively than the polish bomba kryptologiczna from which its name was derived the bombe with an enhancement suggested by mathematician gordon welchman became one of the primary tools and the major automated one used to attack enigmaenciphered messages the bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an enigma message ie rotor order rotor settings and plugboard settings using a suitable crib a fragment of probable plaintext for each possible setting of the rotors which had on the order of  states or  states for the fourrotor uboat variant the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib implemented electromechanically the bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting moving on to the next most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded leaving only a few to be investigated in detail a contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter which was impossible with the enigma the first bombe was installed on  march  action this day by late  turing and his fellow cryptanalysts welchman hugh alexander and stuart milnerbarry were frustrated building on the work of the poles they had set up a good working system for decrypting enigma signals but their limited staff and bombes meant they could not translate all the signals in the summer they had considerable success and shipping losses had fallen to under  tons a month however they badly needed more resources to keep abreast of german adjustments they had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels but had failed on  october they wrote directly to winston churchill explaining their difficulties with turing as the first named they emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces as andrew hodges biographer of turing later wrote this letter had an electric effect churchill wrote a memo to general ismay which read action this day make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done on  november the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken the cryptographers at bletchley park did not know of the prime ministers response but as milnerbarry recalled all that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth more than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war hut  and the naval enigma turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of cracking the german naval use of enigma because no one else was doing anything about it and i could have it to myself in december  turing solved the essential part of the naval indicator system which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services that same night he also conceived of the idea of banburismus a sequential statistical technique what abraham wald later called sequential analysis to assist in breaking the naval enigma though i was not sure that it would work in practice and was not in fact sure until some days had actually broken for this he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the ban banburismus could rule out certain sequences of the enigma rotors substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes later this sequential process of accumulating sufficient weight of evidence using decibans one tenth of a ban was used in cryptanalysis of the lorenz cipher turing travelled to the united states in november  and worked with us navy cryptanalysts on the naval enigma and bombe construction in washington he also visited their computing machine laboratory in dayton ohio turings reaction to the american bombe design was far from enthusiastic the american bombe programme was to produce  bombes one for each wheel order i used to smile inwardly at the conception of bombe hut routine implied by this programme but thought that no particular purpose would be served by pointing out that we would not really use them in that way their test of commutators can hardly be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices nobody seems to be told about rods or offiziers or banburismus unless they are really going to do something about it during this trip he also assisted at bell labs with the development of secure speech devices he returned to bletchley park in march  during his absence hugh alexander had officially assumed the position of head of hut  although alexander had been de facto head for some time turing having little interest in the daytoday running of the section turing became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at bletchley park alexander wrote of turings contribution there should be no question in anyones mind that turings work was the biggest factor in hut s success in the early days he was the only cryptographer who thought the problem worth tackling and not only was he primarily responsible for the main theoretical work within the hut but he also shared with welchman and keen the chief credit for the invention of the bombe it is always difficult to say that anyone is absolutely indispensable but if anyone was indispensable to hut  it was turing the pioneers work always tends to be forgotten when experience and routine later make everything seem easy and many of us in hut  felt that the magnitude of turings contribution was never fully realised by the outside world turingery in july  turing devised a technique termed turingery or jokingly turingismus for use against the lorenz cipher messages produced by the germans new geheimschreiber secret writer machine this was a teleprinter rotor cipher attachment codenamed tunny at bletchley park turingery was a method of wheelbreaking ie a procedure for working out the cam settings of tunnys wheels he also introduced the tunny team to tommy flowers who under the guidance of max newman went on to build the colossus computer the worlds first programmable digital electronic computer which replaced a simpler prior machine the heath robinson and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages some have mistakenly said that turing was a key figure in the design of the colossus computer turingery and the statistical approach of banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about cryptanalysis of the lorenz cipher but he was not directly involved in the colossus development delilah following his work at bell labs in the us turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system in the latter part of the war he moved to work for the secret services radio security service later hmgcc at hanslope park at the park he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of reme officer donald bayley together they undertook the design and construction of a portable secure voice communications machine codenamed delilah the machine was intended for different applications but it lacked the capability for use with longdistance radio transmissions in any case delilah was completed too late to be used during the war though the system worked fully with turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording of a winston churchill speech delilah was not adopted for use turing also consulted with bell labs on the development of sigsaly a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war early computers and the turing test between  and  turing lived in hampton london while he worked on the design of the ace automatic computing engine at the national physical laboratory npl he presented a paper on  february  which was the first detailed design of a storedprogram computer von neumanns incomplete first draft of a report on the edvac had predated turings paper but it was much less detailed and according to john r womersley superintendent of the npl mathematics division it contains a number of ideas which are dr turings own although ace was a feasible design the effect of the official secrets act surrounding the wartime work at bletchley park made it impossible for turing to explain the basis of his analysis of how a computer installation involving human operators would work this led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned in late  he returned to cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on intelligent machinery that was not published in his lifetime while he was at cambridge the pilot ace was being built in his absence it executed its first program on  may  and a number of later computers around the world owe much to it including the english electric deuce and the american bendix g the full version of turings ace was not built until after his death according to the memoirs of the german computer pioneer heinz billing from the max planck institute for physics published by genscher dusseldorf there was a meeting between turing and konrad zuse it took place in gottingen in  the interrogation had the form of a colloquium participants were womersley turing porter from england and a few german researchers like zuse walther and billing for more details see herbert bruderer konrad zuse und die schweiz in  turing was appointed reader in the mathematics department at the university of manchester he lived at copper folly  adlington road in wilmslow a year later he became deputy director of the computing machine laboratory where he worked on software for one of the earliest storedprogram computersthe manchester mark  turing wrote the first version of the programmers manual for this machine was elected to membership of the manchester literary and philosophical society and was recruited by ferranti as a consultant in the development of their commercialised machine the ferranti mark  he continued to be paid consultancy fees by ferranti until his death during this time he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics and in computing machinery and intelligence turing addressed the problem of artificial intelligence and proposed an experiment that became known as the turing test an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called intelligent the idea was that a computer could be said to think if a human interrogator could not tell it apart through conversation from a human being in the paper turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind it would be better to produce a simpler one to simulate a childs mind and then to subject it to a course of education a reversed form of the turing test is widely used on the internet the captcha test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer in  turing working with his former undergraduate colleague dg champernowne began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist by  the program was completed and dubbed the turochamp in  he tried to implement it on a ferranti mark  but lacking enough power the computer was unable to execute the program instead turing ran the program by flipping through the pages of the algorithm and carrying out its instructions on a chessboard taking about half an hour per move the game was recorded according to garry kasparov turings program played a recognizable game of chess the program lost to turings colleague alick glennie although it is said that it won a game against champernownes wife isabel his turing test was a significant characteristically provocative and lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence which continues after more than half a century pattern formation and mathematical biology when turing was  years old in  he turned to mathematical biology finally publishing his masterpiece the chemical basis of morphogenesis in january  he was interested in morphogenesis the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms he suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space termed a reactiondiffusion system could account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis he used systems of partial differential equations to model catalytic chemical reactions for example if a catalyst a is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst a then we say that the reaction is autocatalytic and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst a but also produced an inhibitor b that slowed down the production of a if a and b then diffused through the container at different rates then you could have some regions where a dominated and some where b did to calculate the extent of this turing would have needed a powerful computer but these were not so freely available in  so he had to use linear approximations to solve the equations by hand these calculations gave the right qualitative results and produced for example a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots the russian biochemist boris belousov had performed experiments with similar results but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the second law of thermodynamics belousov was not aware of turings paper in the philosophical transactions of the royal society although published before the structure and role of dna was understood turings work on morphogenesis remains relevant today and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology some of this work aimed to understand plant phyllotaxy specifically how plant primordia form in a ring around the apical meristem during plant growth and development forming fibonacci series one of the early applications of turings paper was the work by james murray explaining spots and stripes on the fur of cats large and small further research in the area suggests that turings work can partially explain the growth of feathers hair follicles the branching pattern of lungs and even the leftright asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest in  sheth et al found that in mice removal of hox genes causes an increase in the number of digits without an increase in the overall size of the limb suggesting that hox genes control digit formation by tuning the wavelength of a turingtype mechanism later papers were not available until collected works of a m turing was published in  a study conducted in  confirmed turings mathematical model hypothesis presented by the american physical society the experiment involved growing chia seeds in even layers within trays later adjusting the available moisture researchers experimentally tweaked the factors which appear in the turing equations and as a result patterns resembling those seen in natural environments emerged this is believed to be the first time that experiments with living vegetation have verified turings mathematical insight personal life treasure in the s turing became worried about losing his savings in the event of a german invasion in order to protect it he bought two silver bars weighing  oz  kg and worth  in   adjusted for inflation  at spot price and buried them in a wood near bletchley park upon returning to dig them up turing found that he was unable to break his own code describing where exactly he had hidden them this along with the fact that the area had been renovated meant that he never regained the silver engagement in  turing proposed marriage to hut  colleague joan clarke a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst but their engagement was shortlived after admitting his homosexuality to his fiancee who was reportedly unfazed by the revelation turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage chess turing invented a hybrid chess sport earlier than chess boxing referred to as roundthehouse chess one player makes a chess move then that player runs around the house and the other player must make a chess move before the first player returns homosexuality and indecency conviction in december  turing met arnold murray a yearold unemployed man turing was walking along manchesters oxford road when he met murray just outside the regal cinema and invited him to lunch the two agreed to meet again and in january  began an intimate relationship on  january turings house in wilmslow was burgled murray told turing that he and the burglar were acquainted and turing reported the crime to the police during the investigation he acknowledged a sexual relationship with murray homosexual acts were criminal offences in the united kingdom at that time and both men were charged with gross indecency under section  of the criminal law amendment act  initial committal proceedings for the trial were held on  february during which turings solicitor reserved his defence ie did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations the proceedings were held at the sessions house in knutsford turing was later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor and he entered a plea of guilty the case regina v turing and murray was brought to trial on  march  turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation his probation would be conditional on his agreement to undergo hormonal physical changes designed to reduce libido known as chemical castration he accepted the option of injections of what was then called stilboestrol now known as diethylstilbestrol or des a synthetic oestrogen this feminization of his body was continued for the course of one year the treatment rendered turing impotent and caused breast tissue to form in a letter turing wrote that no doubt i shall emerge from it all a different man but quite who ive not found out murray was given a conditional discharge turings conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for gchq the british signals intelligence agency that had evolved from gccs in  though he kept his academic post his trial took place only months after the defection to the soviet union of guy burgess and donald maclean in summer  after which the foreign office started to consider anyone known to be homosexual as a potential security risk turing was denied entry into the united states after his conviction in  but was free to visit other european countries in the summer of  he visited norway which was more tolerant of homosexuals among the various men he met there was one named kjell carlson kjell intended to visit turing in the uk but the authorities intercepted kjells postcard detailing his travel arrangements and were able to intercept and deport him before the two could meet it was also during this time that turing started consulting a psychiatrist franz greenbaum with whom he got on well and who subsequently became a family friend death on  june  at his house at  adlington road wilmslow turings housekeeper found him dead a post mortem was held that evening which determined that he had died the previous day at age  with cyanide poisoning cited as the cause of death when his body was discovered an apple lay halfeaten beside his bed and although the apple was not tested for cyanide it was speculated that this was the means by which turing had consumed a fatal dose turings brother john identified the body the following day and took the advice given by franz greenbaum to accept the verdict of the inquest as there was little prospect of establishing that the death was accidental the inquest was held the following day which determined the cause of death to be suicide his nephew writer dermot turing does not believe that his conviction or hormone treatment had anything to do with his suicide he points out that the conviction ended in  and the treatment the following year furthermore no physiological evidence was found that the treatment had any impact on his uncles mental health and he had just made a list of tasks he needed to perform when he got back to his office after a public holiday turing may have inhaled cyanide fumes from an electroplating experiment in his spare room and he often ate an apple before bed leaving it half eaten turings remains were cremated at woking crematorium just two days later on  june  with just his mother brother and lyn newman attending and his ashes were scattered in the gardens of the crematorium just as his fathers had been turings mother was on holiday in italy at the time of his death and returned home after the inquest she never accepted the verdict of suicide philosopher jack copeland has questioned various aspects of the coroners historical verdict he suggested an alternative explanation for the cause of turings death the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus used to electroplate gold onto spoons the potassium cyanide was used to dissolve the gold turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room copeland noted that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison turing also habitually ate an apple before going to bed and it was not unusual for the apple to be discarded halfeaten furthermore turing had reportedly borne his legal setbacks and hormone treatment which had been discontinued a year previously with good humour and had shown no sign of despondency before his death he even set down a list of tasks that he intended to complete upon returning to his office after the holiday weekend turings mother believed that the ingestion was accidental resulting from her sons careless storage of laboratory chemicals turing biographer andrew hodges theorised that turing deliberately made his death look accidental in order to shield his mother from the knowledge that he had killed himself doubts on the suicide thesis have been also cast by john w dawson jr who in his review of hodges book recalls turings vulnerable position in the cold war political climate and points out that turing was found dead by a maid who discovered him lying neatly in his bedhardly what one would expect of a man fighting for life against the suffocation induced by cyanide poisoning turing had given no hint of suicidal inclinations to his friends and had made no effort to put his affairs in order hodges and a later biographer david leavitt have both speculated that turing was reenacting a scene from the walt disney film snow white and the seven dwarfs  his favourite fairy tale both men noted that in leavitts words he took an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the wicked queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew it has also been suggested that turings belief in fortunetelling may have caused his depressed mood as a youth turing had been told by a fortuneteller that he would be a genius in midmay  shortly before his death turing again decided to consult a fortuneteller during a daytrip to st annesonsea with the greenbaum family according to the greenbaums daughter barbara but it was a lovely sunny day and alan was in a cheerful mood and off we went  then he thought it would be a good idea to go to the pleasure beach at blackpool we found a fortunetellers tent and alan said hed like to go in so we waited around for him to come back  and this sunny cheerful visage had shrunk into a pale shaking horrorstricken face something had happened we dont know what the fortuneteller said but he obviously was deeply unhappy i think that was probably the last time we saw him before we heard of his suicide government apology and pardon in august  british programmer john grahamcumming started a petition urging the british government to apologise for turings prosecution as a homosexual the petition received more than  signatures the prime minister gordon brown acknowledged the petition releasing a statement on  september  apologising and describing the treatment of turing as appalling thousands of people have come together to demand justice for alan turing and recognition of the appalling way he was treated while turing was dealt with under the law of the time and we cant put the clock back his treatment was of course utterly unfair and i am pleased to have the chance to say how deeply sorry i and we all are for what happened to him  so on behalf of the british government and all those who live freely thanks to alans work i am very proud to say were sorry you deserved so much better in december  william jones and his member of parliament john leech created an epetition requesting that the british government pardon turing for his conviction of gross indecency we ask the hm government to grant a pardon to alan turing for the conviction of gross indecency in  he was convicted of gross indecency with another man and was forced to undergo socalled organotherapychemical castration two years later he killed himself with cyanide aged just  alan turing was driven to a terrible despair and early death by the nation hed done so much to save this remains a shame on the british government and british history a pardon can go some way to healing this damage it may act as an apology to many of the other gay men not as wellknown as alan turing who were subjected to these laws the petition gathered over  signatures and was submitted to parliament by the manchester mp john leech but the request was discouraged by justice minister lord mcnally who said a posthumous pardon was not considered appropriate as alan turing was properly convicted of what at the time was a criminal offence he would have known that his offence was against the law and that he would be prosecuted it is tragic that alan turing was convicted of an offence that now seems both cruel and absurdparticularly poignant given his outstanding contribution to the war effort however the law at the time required a prosecution and as such longstanding policy has been to accept that such convictions took place and rather than trying to alter the historical context and to put right what cannot be put right ensure instead that we never again return to those times john leech the mp for manchester withington  submitted several bills to parliament and led a highprofile campaign to secure the pardon leech made the case in the house of commons that turings contribution to the war made him a national hero and that it was ultimately just embarrassing that the conviction still stood leech continued to take the bill through parliament and campaigned for several years gaining the public support of numerous leading scientists including stephen hawking on  july  a bill was introduced in the house of lords to grant a statutory pardon to turing for offences under section  of the criminal law amendment act  of which he was convicted on  march  late in the year in a letter to the daily telegraph the physicist stephen hawking and  other signatories including the astronomer royal lord rees president of the royal society sir paul nurse lady trumpington who worked for turing during the war and lord sharkey the bills sponsor called on prime minister david cameron to act on the pardon request the government indicated it would support the bill and it passed its third reading in the house of lords in october at the bills second reading in the house of commons on  november  conservative mp christopher chope objected to the bill delaying its passage the bill was due to return to the house of commons on  february  but before the bill could be debated in the house of commons the government elected to proceed under the royal prerogative of mercy on  december  queen elizabeth ii signed a pardon for turings conviction for gross indecency with immediate effect announcing the pardon lord chancellor chris grayling said turing deserved to be remembered and recognised for his fantastic contribution to the war effort and not for his later criminal conviction the queen pronounced turing pardoned in august  it was only the fourth royal pardon granted since the conclusion of the second world war pardons are normally granted only when the person is technically innocent and a request has been made by the family or other interested party neither condition was met in regard to turings conviction in september  the government announced its intention to expand this retroactive exoneration to other men convicted of similar historical indecency offences in what was described as an alan turing law the alan turing law is now an informal term for the law in the united kingdom contained in the policing and crime act  which serves as an amnesty law to retroactively pardon men who were cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts the law applies in england and wales due to his repeated attempts to bring attention to the issue leech is now regularly described as the architect of turings pardon and subsequently the alan turing law which went on to secure pardons for  other men and women at the british premiere of a film based on turings life the imitation game the producers thanked leech for bringing the topic to public attention and securing turings pardon on  july  following an apology to lgbt veterans from the uk government defence secretary ben wallace suggested turing should be honoured with a permanent statue on the fourth plinth of trafalgar square describing turing as probably the greatest war hero in my book of the second world war whose achievements shortened the war saved thousands of lives helped defeat the nazis and his story is a sad story of a society and how it treated him further
