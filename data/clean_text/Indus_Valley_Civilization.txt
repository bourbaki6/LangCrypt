the indus valley civilisation ivc also known as the indus civilisation was a bronze age civilisation in the northwestern regions of south asia lasting from  bce to  bce and in its mature form from  bce to  bce together with ancient egypt and mesopotamia it was one of three early civilisations of the near east and south asia of the three it was the most widespread it spanned much of pakistan northwestern india and northeast afghanistan the civilisation flourished both in the alluvial plain of the indus river which flows through the length of pakistan and along a system of perennial monsoonfed rivers that once coursed in the vicinity of the ghaggarhakra a seasonal river in northwest india and eastern pakistan the term harappan is also applied to the indus civilisation after its type site harappa the first to be excavated early in the th century in what was then the punjab province of british india and is now punjab pakistan the discovery of harappa and soon afterwards mohenjodaro was the culmination of work that had begun after the founding of the archaeological survey of india in the british raj in  there were earlier and later cultures called early harappan and late harappan in the same area the early harappan cultures were populated from neolithic cultures the earliest and bestknown of which is named after mehrgarh in balochistan pakistan harappan civilisation is sometimes called mature harappan to distinguish it from the earlier cultures the cities of the ancient indus were noted for their urban planning baked brick houses elaborate drainage systems water supply systems clusters of large nonresidential buildings and techniques of handicraft and metallurgy mohenjodaro and harappa very likely grew to contain between  and  individuals and the civilisation may have contained between one and five million individuals during its florescence a gradual drying of the region during the rd millennium bce may have been the initial stimulus for its urbanisation eventually it also reduced the water supply enough to cause the civilisations demise and to disperse its population to the east although over a thousand mature harappan sites have been reported and nearly a hundred excavated there are only five major urban centres mohenjodaro in the lower indus valley declared a unesco world heritage site in  as archaeological ruins at moenjodaro harappa in the western punjab region ganeriwala in the cholistan desert dholavira in western gujarat declared a unesco world heritage site in  as dholavira a harappan city and rakhigarhi in haryana the harappan language is not directly attested and its affiliations are uncertain as the indus script has remained undeciphered a relationship with the dravidian or elamodravidian language family is favoured by a section of scholars etymology the indus valley civilisation is named after the indus river system in whose alluvial plains the early sites of the civilisation were identified and excavated following a tradition in archaeology the civilisation is sometimes referred to as the harappan after its type site harappa the first site to be excavated in the s this is notably true of usage employed by the archaeological survey of india after indias independence in  the term ghaggarhakra figures prominently in modern labels applied to the indus civilisation on account of a good number of sites having been found along the ghaggarhakra river in northwest india and eastern pakistan the terms indussarasvati civilisation and sindhusaraswati civilisation have also been employed in the literature by supporters of indigenous aryanism after a posited identification of the ghaggarhakra with the river sarasvati described in the early chapters of the rigveda a collection of hymns in archaic sanskrit composed in the secondmillennium bce which are unrelated to the mature phase of the indus valley civilization recent geophysical research suggests that unlike the sarasvati described in the rigveda as a snowfed river the ghaggarhakra was a system of perennial monsoonfed rivers which became seasonal around the time the civilisation diminished approximately  years ago extent the indus valley civilisation was roughly contemporary with the other riverine civilisations of the ancient world ancient egypt along the nile mesopotamia in the lands watered by the euphrates and the tigris and china in the drainage basin of the yellow river and the yangtze by the time of its mature phase the civilisation had spread over an area larger than the others which included a core of  kilometres  mi up the alluvial plain of the indus and its tributaries in addition there was a region with disparate flora fauna and habitats up to ten times as large which had been shaped culturally and economically by the indus around  bce agriculture emerged in balochistan on the margins of the indus alluvium in the following millennia settled life made inroads into the indus plains setting the stage for the growth of rural and urban settlements the more organised sedentary life in turn led to a net increase in the birth rate the large urban centres of mohenjodaro and harappa very likely grew to containing between  and  individuals and during the civilisations florescence the population of the subcontinent grew to between  million people during this period the death rate increased as the close living conditions of humans and domesticated animals led to an increase in contagious diseases according to one estimate the population of the indus civilisation at its peak may have been between one and five million during its height the civilisation extended from balochistan in the west to western uttar pradesh in the east from northeastern afghanistan in the north to gujarat state in the south the largest number of sites are in the punjab region gujarat haryana rajasthan uttar pradesh jammu and kashmir states sindh and balochistan coastal settlements extended from sutkagan dor in western baluchistan to lothal in gujarat an indus valley site has been found on the oxus river at shortugai in afghanistan which is the northernmost site of the indus valley civilisation in the gomal river valley in northwestern pakistan at manda jammu on the beas river near jammu and at alamgirpur on the hindon river only  km  mi from delhi the southernmost site of the indus valley civilisation is daimabad in maharashtra indus valley sites have been found most often on rivers but also on the ancient seacoast for example balakot kot bala and on islands for example dholavira discovery and history of excavation the first modern accounts of the ruins of the indus civilisation are those of charles masson a deserter from the east india companys army in  masson traveled through the princely state of punjab gathering useful intelligence for the company in return for a promise of clemency an aspect of this arrangement was the additional requirement to hand over to the company any historical artifacts acquired during his travels masson who had versed himself in the classics especially in the military campaigns of alexander the great chose for his wanderings some of the same towns that had featured in alexanders campaigns and whose archaeological sites had been noted by the campaigns chroniclers massons major archaeological discovery in the punjab was harappa a metropolis of the indus civilisation in the valley of induss tributary the ravi river masson made copious notes and illustrations of harappas rich historical artifacts many lying halfburied in  masson included his observations of harappa in the book narrative of various journeys in baluchistan afghanistan and the punjab he dated the harappa ruins to a period of recorded history erroneously mistaking it to have been described earlier during alexanders campaign masson was impressed by the sites extraordinary size and by several large mounds formed from longexisting erosion two years later the company contracted alexander burnes to sail up the indus to assess the feasibility of water travel for its army burnes who also stopped in harappa noted the baked bricks employed in the sites ancient masonry but noted also the haphazard plundering of these bricks by the local population despite these reports harappa was raided even more perilously for its bricks after the british annexation of the punjab in  a considerable number were carted away as track ballast for the railway lines being laid in the punjab nearly  km  mi of railway track between multan and lahore laid in the mids was supported by harappan bricks in  three years after the dissolution of the east india company and the establishment of crown rule in india archaeology on the subcontinent became more formally organised with the founding of the archaeological survey of india asi alexander cunningham the surveys first directorgeneral who had visited harappa in  and had noted the imposing brick walls visited again to carry out a survey but this time of a site whose entire upper layer had been stripped in the interim although his original goal of demonstrating harappa to be a lost buddhist city mentioned in the seventh century ce travels of the chinese visitor xuanzang proved elusive cunningham did publish his findings in  for the first time he interpreted a harappan stamp seal with its unknown script which he concluded to be of an origin foreign to india archaeological work in harappa thereafter lagged until a new viceroy of india lord curzon pushed through the ancient monuments preservation act  and appointed john marshall to lead the asi several years later hiranand sastri who had been assigned by marshall to survey harappa reported it to be of nonbuddhist origin and by implication more ancient expropriating harappa for the asi under the act marshall directed asi archaeologist daya ram sahni to excavate the sites two mounds farther south along the main stem of the indus in sind province the largely undisturbed site of mohenjodaro had attracted notice marshall deputed a succession of asi officers to survey the site these included d r bhandarkar  r d banerji   and m s vats  in  on his second visit to mohenjodaro baneriji wrote to marshall about the site postulating an origin in remote antiquity and noting a congruence of some of its artifacts with those of harappa later in  vats also in correspondence with marshall noted the same more specifically about the seals and the script found at both sites on the weight of these opinions marshall ordered crucial data from the two sites to be brought to one location and invited banerji and sahni to a joint discussion by  marshall had become convinced of the significance of the finds and on  september  made a tentative but conspicuous public intimation in the illustrated london news not often has it been given to archaeologists as it was given to schliemann at tiryns and mycenae or to stein in the deserts of turkestan to light upon the remains of a long forgotten civilisation it looks however at this moment as if we were on the threshold of such a discovery in the plains of the indus in the next issue a week later the british assyriologist archibald sayce was able to point to very similar seals found in bronze age levels in mesopotamia and iran giving the first strong indication of their date confirmations from other archaeologists followed systematic excavations began in mohenjodaro in  with that of k n dikshit continuing with those of h hargreaves  and ernest j h mackay  by  much of mohenjodaro had been excavated but occasional excavations continued such as the one led by mortimer wheeler a new directorgeneral of the asi appointed in  and including ahmad hasan dani after the partition of india in  when most excavated sites of the indus valley civilisation lay in territory awarded to pakistan the archaeological survey of india its area of authority reduced carried out large numbers of surveys and excavations along the ghaggarhakra system in india some speculated that the ghaggarhakra system might yield more sites than the indus river basin according to archaeologist shireen ratnagar many ghaggarhakra sites in india are actually those of local cultures with distinctive local potterry but which had contacts with harappan civilisation few are fully developed harappan sites as of  about  of the indus script seals and inscribed objects discovered were found at sites in pakistan along the indus river while other sites accounts only for the remaining  by  over  mature harappan cities and settlements had been reported of which just under a hundred had been excavated mainly in the general region of the indus and ghaggarhakra rivers and their tributaries however there are only five major urban sites harappa mohenjodaro dholavira ganeriwala and rakhigarhi as of  about  sites have been reported in india whereas  sites have been reported in pakistan unlike india in which after  the asi attempted to indianise archaeological work in keeping with the new nations goals of national unity and historical continuity in pakistan the national imperative was the promotion of islamic heritage and consequently archaeological work on early sites was left to foreign archaeologists after the partition mortimer wheeler the director of asi from  oversaw the establishment of archaeological institutions in pakistan later joining a unesco effort tasked to conserve the site at mohenjodaro other international efforts at mohenjodaro and harappa have included the german aachen research project mohenjodaro the italian mission to mohenjodaro and the us harappa archaeological research project harp founded by george f dales following a chance flash flood which exposed a portion of an archaeological site at the foot of the bolan pass in balochistan excavations were carried out in mehrgarh by french archaeologist jeanfrancois jarrige and his team in the early s chronology the cities of the ancient indus had social hierarchies their writing system their large planned cities and their longdistance trade which mark them to archaeologists as a fullfledged civilisation the mature phase of the harappan civilisation lasted from c  bce with the inclusion of the predecessor and successor cultures  early harappan and late harappan respectively  the entire indus valley civilisation may be taken to have lasted from the rd to the th centuries bce it is part of the indus valley tradition which also includes the preharappan occupation of mehrgarh the earliest farming site of the indus valley several periodisations are employed for the ivc the most commonly used classifies the indus valley civilisation into early mature and late harappan phase an alternative approach by shaffer divides the broader indus valley tradition into four eras the preharappan early food producing era and the regionalisation integration and localisation eras which correspond roughly with the early harappan mature harappan and late harappan phases preharappan era mehrgarh mehrgarh is a neolithic  bce to c  bce mountain site in the balochistan province of pakistan which gave new insights on the emergence of the indus valley civilisation mehrgarh is one of the earliest sites with evidence of farming and herding in south asia mehrgarh was influenced by the near eastern neolithic with similarities between domesticated wheat varieties early phases of farming pottery other archaeological artefacts some domesticated plants and herd animals jeanfrancois jarrige argues for an independent origin of mehrgarh jarrige notes the assumption that farming economy was introduced fullfledged from neareast to south asia and the similarities between neolithic sites from eastern mesopotamia and the western indus valley which are evidence of a cultural continuum between those sites but given the originality of mehrgarh jarrige concludes that mehrgarh has an earlier local background and is not a backwater of the neolithic culture of the near east lukacs and hemphill suggest an initial local development of mehrgarh with a continuity in cultural development but a change in population according to lukacs and hemphill while there is a strong continuity between the neolithic and chalcolithic copper age cultures of mehrgarh dental evidence shows that the chalcolithic population did not descend from the neolithic population of mehrgarh which suggests moderate levels of gene flow mascarenhas et al  note that new possibly west asian body types are reported from the graves of mehrgarh beginning in the togau phase  bce gallego romero et al  state that their research on lactose tolerance in india suggests that the west eurasian genetic contribution identified by reich et al  principally reflects gene flow from iran and the middle east they further note that the earliest evidence of cattle herding in south asia comes from the indus river valley site of mehrgarh and is dated to  ybp early harappan the early harappan ravi phase named after the nearby ravi river lasted from c  bce until  bce it started when farmers from the mountains gradually moved between their mountain homes and the lowland river valleys and is related to the hakra phase identified in the ghaggarhakra river valley to the west and predates the kot diji phase  bce harappan  named after a site in northern sindh pakistan near mohenjodaro the earliest examples of the indus script date to the rd millennium bce the mature phase of earlier village cultures is represented by rehman dheri and amri in pakistan kot diji represents the phase leading up to mature harappan with the citadel representing centralised authority and an increasingly urban quality of life another town of this stage was found at kalibangan in india on the hakra river trade networks linked this culture with related regional cultures and distant sources of raw materials including lapis lazuli and other materials for beadmaking by this time villagers had domesticated numerous crops including peas sesame seeds dates and cotton as well as animals including the water buffalo early harappan communities turned to large urban centres by  bce from where the mature harappan phase started the latest research shows that indus valley people migrated from villages to cities the final stages of the early harappan period are characterised by the building of large walled settlements the expansion of trade networks and the increasing integration of regional communities into a relatively uniform material culture in terms of pottery styles ornaments and stamp seals with indus script leading into the transition to the mature harappan phase mature harappan according to giosan et al  the slow southward migration of the monsoons across asia initially allowed the indus valley villages to develop by taming the floods of the indus and its tributaries floodsupported farming led to large agricultural surpluses which in turn supported the development of cities the ivc residents did not develop irrigation capabilities relying mainly on the seasonal monsoons leading to summer floods brooke further notes that the development of advanced cities coincides with a reduction in rainfall which may have triggered a reorganisation into larger urban centres according to jg shaffer and da lichtenstein the mature harappan civilisation was a fusion of the bagor hakra and kot diji traditions or ethnic groups in the ghaggarhakra valley on the borders of india and pakistan also according to a more recent summary by maisels  the harappan oecumene formed from a kot dijianamrinal synthesis he also says that in the development of complexity the site of mohenjodaro has priority along with the hakraghaggar cluster of sites where hakra wares actually precede the kot diji related material he sees these areas as catalytic in producing the fusion from hakra kot dijian and amrinal cultural elements that resulted in the gestalt we recognize as early harappan early indus by  bce the early harappan communities turned into large urban centres such urban centres include harappa ganeriwala mohenjodaro in modernday pakistan and dholavira kalibangan rakhigarhi rupar and lothal in modernday india in total more than  settlements have been found mainly in the general region of the indus and ghaggarhakra rivers and their tributaries cities a sophisticated and technologically advanced urban culture is evident in the indus valley civilisation making them the first urban centre in the region the high degree of forwardlooking urban planning demonstrates the existence of wellorganised local governments capable of formulating and executing a largescale forwardlooking development program and which placed a high value on public health and hygiene or alternatively accessibility to the means of religious ritual as seen in harappa mohenjodaro and the recently partially excavated rakhigarhi this urban plan included the worlds first known city sanitation systems within the city individual homes or groups of homes obtained water from wells from a room that appears to have been set aside for bathing waste water was directed to covered drains which lined the major streets houses opened only to inner courtyards and smaller lanes the housebuilding in some villages in the region still resembles in some respects the housebuilding of the harappans the indus valley cities developed elaborate drainage and sewerage systems described by archaeologists as wellplanned and advanced compared with many contemporary societies their urban architecture included dockyards granaries warehouses brick platforms and massive protective walls which were likely intended both as flood defenses and as fortifications the purpose of the citadel remains debated in sharp contrast to this civilisations contemporaries mesopotamia and ancient egypt no large monumental structures were built there is no conclusive evidence of palaces or temples some structures are thought to have been granaries found at one city is an enormous wellbuilt bath the great bath which may have been a public bath although the citadels were walled it is far from clear that these structures were defensive many may have been flood defenses most city dwellers appear to have been traders or artisans who lived with others pursuing the same occupation in welldefined neighbourhoods materials from distant regions were used in the cities for constructing seals beads and other objects among the artefacts discovered were beautiful glazed faience beads steatite seals have images of animals people perhaps gods and other types of inscriptions including the yet undeciphered writing system of the indus valley civilisation some of the seals were used to stamp clay on trade goods although some houses were larger than others indus valley civilisation cities were remarkable for their apparent if relative egalitarianism all the houses had access to water and drainage facilities this gives the impression of a society with relatively low wealth concentration authority and governance archaeological records provide no immediate answers for the question of who ruled harappan cities and how nonetheless there are indications of complex decisions being taken and largescale mobilisation of resources for instance the majority of the cities were constructed in a highly uniform and wellplanned grid pattern divided into two levels from ground making one part slightly higher than the other such complex urban planning combined with the construction of large public works projects demonstrates the existence of some sort of planning authority the remarkable consistency of harappan weights and measures as evident in pottery seals weights and bricks also indicates the existence of a central authority able to make definitive regulations these are some major theories there was a single state or federation ruling all or most of the indus valley proponents of this theory believe that the presence of standardised weights and measures demonstrates the presence of a central authority there was no single ruler with each city being a selfgoverning city state metallurgy copper was abundant at indus sites as revealed by archaeology in his  study of harappan and indus copper industry brett hoffman analyzed extensive copperbronze assemblages from harappa he used advanced techniques such as scanning electron microscopy sem to understand production consumption and trade in copper ore the study revealed regional patterns and detailed technological aspects of bronze production in harappa and in indus valley civilisation more generally indus bronze was alloyed with tin arsenic and lead hoffman examined a large collections of copperbronze artifacts from harappa covering the timeline from  to  bce and challenged some older broad interpretations of bronze production he studied how copper was acquired processed and used for diverse items such as tools and prestige goods the production increased especially starting with the kot diji phase but the early harappan groups were already well acquainted with copper metallurgy major copper and copper ore sources used by indus valley civilisation included rajasthan khetri mines and as far as oman and bahrain the aravalli range in northwestern india was particularly important a touchstone bearing gold streaks was found in banawali which was probably used for testing the purity of gold such a technique is still used in some parts of india contrary to the older ideas of elite control over metal production recent research indicates that access to copper and bronze was relatively widespread throughout the indus society metrology the people of the indus valley civilisation achieved great accuracy in measuring length mass and time they were among the first to develop a system of uniform weights and measures a comparison of available objects indicates large scale variation across the indus territories their smallest division which is marked on an ivory scale found in lothal in gujarat was approximately  mm the smallest division ever recorded on a scale of the bronze age harappan engineers followed the decimal division of measurement for all practical purposes including the measurement of mass as revealed by their hexahedron weights these chert weights were in a ratio of  with weights of             and  units with each unit weighing approximately  grams similar to the english imperial ounce or greek uncia and smaller objects were weighed in similar ratios with the units of  however as in other cultures actual weights were not uniform throughout the area the weights and measures later used in kautilyas arthashastra th century bce are the same as those used in lothal arts and crafts many indus valley seals and items in pottery and terracotta have been found along with a very few stone sculptures and some gold jewellery and bronze vessels some anatomically detailed figurines in terracotta bronze and steatite have been found at excavation sites the former probably mostly toys the harappans also made various toys and games among them cubical dice with one to six holes on the faces which were found in sites like mohenjodaro the terracotta figurines included cows bears monkeys and dogs the animal depicted on a majority of seals at sites of the mature period has not been clearly identified part bull part zebra with a majestic horn it has been a source of speculation as yet there is insufficient evidence to substantiate claims that the image had religious or cultic significance but the prevalence of the image raises the question of whether or not the animals in images of the ivc are religious symbols many crafts including shell working ceramics and agate and glazed steatite bead making were practised and the pieces were used in the making of necklaces bangles and other ornaments from all phases of harappan culture some of these crafts are still practised in the subcontinent today some makeup and toiletry items a special kind of combs kakai the use of collyrium and a special threeinone toiletry gadget that were found in harappan contexts still have similar counterparts in modern india terracotta female figurines were found c  bce which had red colour applied to the manga line of partition of the hair archeological remains from  to  bc have been found from the city of lothal of pieces on a board that resemble chess the finds from mohenjodaro were initially deposited in the lahore museum but later moved to the asi headquarters at new delhi where a new central imperial museum was being planned for the new capital of the british raj in which at least a selection would be displayed it became apparent that indian independence was approaching but the partition of india was not anticipated until late in the process the new pakistani authorities requested the return of the mohenjodaro pieces excavated on their territory but the indian authorities refused eventually an agreement was reached whereby the finds totalling some  objects most sherds of pottery were split equally between the countries in some cases this was taken very literally with some necklaces and girdles having their beads separated into two piles in the case of the two most celebrated sculpted figures pakistan asked for and received the socalled priestking figure while india retained the much smaller dancing girl though written considerably later the arts treatise natya shastra c  bce   ce classifies musical instruments into four groups based on their means of acoustical productionstrings membranes solid materials and airand it is probable that such instruments had existed since the ivc archeological evidence indicates the use of simple rattles and vessel flutes while iconographical evidence suggests early harps and drums were also used an ideogram in the ivc contains the earliest known depiction of an arched harp dated sometime before  bce human statuettes a handful of realistic statuettes have been found at ivc sites of which much the most famous is the lostwax casting bronze statuette of a slenderlimbed dancing girl adorned with bangles found in mohenjodaro two other realistic incomplete statuettes have been found in harappa in proper stratified excavations which display nearclassical treatment of the human shape the statuette of a dancer who seems to be male and the harappa torso a red jasper male torso both now in the delhi national museum sir john marshall reacted with surprise when he saw these two statuettes from harappa when i first saw them i found it difficult to believe that they were prehistoric they seemed to completely upset all established ideas about early art and culture modelling such as this was unknown in the ancient world up to the hellenistic age of greece and i thought therefore that some mistake must surely have been made that these figures had found their way into levels some  years older than those to which they properly belonged  now in these statuettes it is just this anatomical truth which is so startling that makes us wonder whether in this allimportant matter greek artistry could possibly have been anticipated by the sculptors of a faroff age on the banks of the indus these statuettes remain controversial due to their advanced style in representing the human body regarding the red jasper torso the discoverer vats claims a harappan date but marshall considered this statuette is probably historical dating to the gupta period comparing it to the much later lohanipur torso a second rather similar grey stone torso of a dancing male was also found about  meters away in a secure mature harappan stratum overall anthropologist gregory possehl tends to consider that these statuettes probably form the pinnacle of indus art during the mature harappan period seals thousands of steatite seals have been recovered and their physical character is fairly consistent in size they range from squares of side  to  cm  to  in in most cases they have a pierced boss at the back to accommodate a cord for handling or for use as personal adornment in addition a large number of sealings have survived of which only a few can be matched to the seals the great majority of examples of the indus script are short groups of signs on seals seals have been found at mohenjodaro depicting a figure standing on its head and another on the pashupati seal sitting crosslegged in what some call a yogalike pose see image the socalled pashupati below this figure has been variously identified sir john marshall identified a resemblance to the hindu god shiva a human deity with the horns hooves and tail of a bull also appears in the seals in particular in a fighting scene with a horned tigerlike beast this deity has been compared to the mesopotamian bullman enkidu several seals also show a man fighting two lions or tigers a master of animals motif common to civilisations in western and south asia trade and transportation the indus valley civilisation may have had bullock carts identical to those seen throughout south asia today as well as boats most of these boats were probably small flatbottomed craft perhaps driven by sail similar to those one can see on the indus river today an extensive canal network used for irrigation has however also been discovered by hp francfort during  bce of the chalcolithic period copper age the indus valley civilisation area shows ceramic similarities with southern turkmenistan and northern iran which suggest considerable mobility and trade during the early harappan period about  bce similarities in pottery seals figurines ornaments etc document intensive caravan trade with central asia and the iranian plateau judging from the dispersal of indus valley civilisation artefacts the trade networks economically integrated a huge area including portions of afghanistan the coastal regions of persia connected by the gulf of oman from the arabian sea northern and western india and mesopotamia leading to the development of indusmesopotamia relations studies of tooth enamel from individuals buried at harappa suggest that some residents had migrated to the city from beyond the indus valley ancient dna studies of graves at bronze age sites at gonur depe turkmenistan and shahre sukhteh iran have identified  individuals of south asian descent who are presumed to be of mature indus valley origin there was an extensive maritime trade network operating between the harappan and mesopotamian civilisations as early as the middle harappan phase with much commerce being handled by middlemen merchants from dilmun modern bahrain eastern arabia and failaka located in the persian gulf such longdistance sea trade became feasible with the development of plankbuilt watercraft equipped with a single central mast supporting a sail of woven rushes or cloth however the evidence of seaborne trade involving the harappan civilisation is not firm in their book rise of civilization in india and pakistan archaeologists bridget allchin and raymond allchin write  p  the settlement at lothal  along the east side was a brick basin it is claimed by its excavator to have been a dockyard connected by channels to a neighbouring estuary  on its edge the excavator discovered several heavilypierced stones similar to modern anchor stones employed by traditional seafaring communities of western india this interpretation however has been challenged and indeed the published levels of the basin and its entrance relative to the modern sea level seem to argue against it leshnik has cogently suggested that it was a tank for the reception of sweet water channelled from higher ground inland to an area where the local water supplies were anciently as still today saline we regard either interpretation as still unproven but favour the latter  p  the discussion of trade focuses attention upon methods of transport several representations of ships are found on seals and graffiti at harappa mohenjodaro figs  etc and a terracotta model of a ship with a stick impressed socket for the mast and eyeholes for fixing rigging comes from lothal we have already seen above that the great brick tank interpreted by rao as a dock at lothal cannot yet be certainly identified the evidence of sea trade and contact during the harappan period is largely circumstantial or derived from inferences from the mesopotamian texts as detailed above figure   had caption mohenjodaro representation of ship on a stone seal length  cm after mackay figure  mohenjodaro representation of ship on terracotta amulet length  cm after dales daniel t potts writes it is generally assumed that most trade between the indus valley ancient meluhha and western neighbors proceeded up the persian gulf rather than overland although there is no incontrovertible proof that this was indeed the case the distribution of industype artifacts on the oman peninsula on bahrain and in southern mesopotamia makes it plausible that a series of maritime stages linked the indus valley and the gulf region if this is accepted then the presence of etched carnelian beads a harappanstyle cubical stone weight and a harappanstyle cylinder seal at susa amiet a figs  may be evidence of maritime trade between susa and the indus valley in the late rd millennium bce on the other hand given that similar finds particularly etched carnelian beads are attested at landlocked sites including tepe hissar tappe hesar shah tepe sahtappe kalleh nisar kalla nisar jalalabad jalalabad marlik marlik and tepe yahya tappe yahya possehl  pp  other mechanisms including overland traffic by peddlers or caravans may account for their presence at susa in the s important archaeological discoveries were made at ras aljinz oman demonstrating maritime indus valley connections with the arabian peninsula dennys frenez recently regards that industype and indusrelated artifacts were found over a large and differentiated ecumene encompassing central asia the iranian plateau mesopotamia and the northern levant the persian gulf and the oman peninsula the discovery of indus trade tools seals weights and containers across the entire middle asia complemented by information from mesopotamian cuneiform texts shows that entrepreneurs from the indus valley regularly ventured into these regions to transact with the local socioeconomic and political entities however indus artifacts were also exchanged beyond this core region eventually reaching as far as the nile river valley anatolia and the caucasus on the contrary only a handful of exotic trade tools and commodities have been found at sites in the greater indus valley the success of indus trade in central and western asia did not only rely on the dynamic entrepreneurialism of indus merchants and the exotic commodities they offered specific products were proactively designed and manufactured in the indus valley to fulfill the particular needs of foreign markets and indus craftspeople moved beyond their native cultural sphere adapting their distinctive productions to the taste of foreign elites or reworking indigenous models the adoption of specific seals and iconographies to regulate external trade activities suggests a conscious attempt at implementing a coordinated supraregional marketing strategy agriculture according to gangal et al  there is strong archeological and geographical evidence that neolithic farming spread from the near east into northwest india but there is also good evidence for the local domestication of barley and the zebu cattle at mehrgarh according to jeanfrancois jarrige farming had an independent local origin at mehrgarh which he argues is not merely a backwater of the neolithic culture of the near east despite similarities between neolithic sites from eastern mesopotamia and the western indus valley which are evidence of a cultural continuum between those sites archaeologist jim g shaffer writes that the mehrgarh site demonstrates that food production was an indigenous south asian phenomenon and that the data support interpretation of the prehistoric urbanisation and complex social organisation in south asia as based on indigenous but not isolated cultural developments jarrige notes that the people of mehrgarh used domesticated wheats and barley while shaffer and liechtenstein note that the major cultivated cereal crop was naked sixrow barley a crop derived from tworow barley gangal agrees that neolithic domesticated crops in mehrgarh include more than  barley noting that there is good evidence for the local domestication of barley yet gangal also notes that the crop also included a small amount of wheat which are suggested to be of neareastern origin as the modern distribution of wild varieties of wheat is limited to northern levant and southern turkey the cattle that are often portrayed on indus seals are humped indian aurochs bos primigenius namadicus which are similar to zebu cattle zebu cattle are still common in india and in africa they are different from european cattle bos primigenius taurus and are believed to have been independently domesticated on the indian subcontinent probably in the baluchistan region of pakistan research by j bates et al  confirms that indus populations were the earliest people to use complex multicropping strategies across both seasons growing foods during summer rice millets and beans and winter wheat barley and pulses which required different watering regimes bates et al  also found evidence for an entirely separate domestication process of rice in ancient south asia based around the wild species oryza nivara this led to the local development of a mix of wetland and dryland agriculture of local oryza sativa indica rice agriculture before the truly wetland rice oryza sativa japonica arrived around  bce food according to archeological finds the indus valley civilisation had a diet dominated by meats of animals such as cattle buffalo goat pig and chicken remnants of dairy products were also discovered according to akshyeta suryanarayan et al available evidence indicates culinary practices to be common over the region foodconstituents were dairy products in low proportion ruminant carcass meat and either nonruminant adipose fats plants or mixtures of these products the dietary pattern remained the same throughout the decline seven foodballs laddus were found in intact form along with two figurines of bulls and a handheld copper adze during excavations in  from western rajasthan dated to about  bce they were likely composed of legumes primarily mung and cereals the authors speculated the foodballs to be of a ritualistic significance given the finds of bull figurines adze and a seal in immediate vicinity language the harappan language is the unknown language or languages of the indus valley civilization the harappan script is yet undeciphered indeed it has not even been demonstrated to be a writing system and therefore the language remains unknown the language being yet unattested in readable contemporary sources hypotheses regarding its nature are based on possible loanwords the substratum in vedic sanskrit and some terms recorded in sumerian cuneiform such as meluhha in conjunction with analyses of the harappan script there are some possible loanwords from the language of the indus valley civilization meluhha or melukhkha sumerian  meluhhaki is the sumerian name of a prominent trading partner of sumer during the middle bronze age its identification remains an open question but most scholars associate it with the indus valley civilisation of the substratum in vedic sanskrit the bulk have no proven basis in any of the known families suggesting a source in one or more lost languages one of these lost languages could have been the harappan language which witzel labelled as the kubhavipas substrate one hypothesis has been suggested that the bearers of the ivc corresponded to protodravidians linguistically the breakup of protodravidian corresponding to the breakup of the late harappan culture finnish indologist asko parpola concludes that the uniformity of the indus inscriptions precludes any possibility of widely different languages being used and that an early form of dravidian language must have been the language of the indus people today the dravidian language family is concentrated mostly in southern india and northern and eastern sri lanka but pockets of it still remain throughout the rest of india and pakistan the brahui language which lends credence to the theory possible writing system between  and as many as  distinct indus symbols have been found on stamp seals small tablets ceramic pots and more than a dozen other materials including a signboard that apparently once hung over the gate of the inner citadel of the indus city of dholavira typical indus inscriptions are around five characters in length most of which aside from the dholavira signboard are tiny the longest on any single object inscribed on a copper plate has a length of  symbols while the indus valley civilisation is generally characterised as a literate society on the evidence of these inscriptions this description has been challenged by farmer sproat and witzel  who argue that the indus system did not encode language but was instead similar to a variety of nonlinguistic sign systems used extensively in the near east and other societies to symbolise families clans gods and religious concepts others have claimed on occasion that the symbols were exclusively used for economic transactions but this claim leaves unexplained the appearance of indus symbols on many ritual objects many of which were massproduced in moulds no parallels to these massproduced inscriptions are known in any other early ancient civilisations in a  study by pn rao et al published in science computer scientists comparing the pattern of symbols to various linguistic scripts and nonlinguistic systems including dna and a computer programming language found that the indus scripts pattern is closer to that of spoken words supporting the hypothesis that it codes for an asyetunknown language farmer sproat and witzel have disputed this finding pointing out that rao et al did not actually compare the indus signs with realworld nonlinguistic systems but rather with two wholly artificial systems invented by the authors one consisting of  randomly ordered signs and another of  fully ordered signs that they spuriously claim represent the structures of all realworld nonlinguistic sign systems farmer et al have also demonstrated that a comparison of a nonlinguistic system like medieval heraldic signs with natural languages yields results similar to those that rao et al obtained with indus signs they conclude that the method used by rao et al cannot distinguish linguistic systems from nonlinguistic ones the messages on the seals have proved to be too short to be decoded by a computer each seal has a distinctive combination of symbols and there are too few examples of each sequence to provide a sufficient context the symbols that accompany the images vary from seal to seal making it impossible to derive a meaning for the symbols from the images there have nonetheless been a number of interpretations offered for the meaning of the seals these interpretations have been marked by ambiguity and subjectivity photos of many of the thousands of extant inscriptions are published in the corpus of indus seals and inscriptions    edited by asko parpola and his colleagues the most recent volume republished photos taken in the s and s of hundreds of lost or stolen inscriptions along with many discovered in the last few decades formerly researchers had to supplement the materials in the corpus by study of the tiny photos in the excavation reports of marshall  mackay   wheeler  or reproductions in more recent scattered sources religion the religion and belief system of the indus valley people has received considerable attention especially from the view of identifying precursors to deities and religious practices of indian religions that later developed in the area however due to the sparsity of evidence which is open to varying interpretations and the fact that the indus script remains undeciphered the conclusions are partly speculative and largely based on a retrospective view from a much later hindu perspective early and influential work in the area that set the trend for hindu interpretations of archaeological evidence from the harappan sites was that of john marshall who in  identified the following as prominent features of the indus religion a great male god and a mother goddess deification or veneration of animals and plants a symbolic representation of the phallus linga and vulva yoni and use of baths and water in religious practice marshalls interpretations have been much debated and sometimes disputed over the following decades one indus valley seal shows a seated figure with a horned headdress possibly tricephalic and possibly ithyphallic surrounded by animals marshall identified the figure as an early form of the hindu god shiva or rudra who is associated with asceticism yoga and linga regarded as a lord of animals and often depicted as having three eyes the seal has hence come to be known as the pashupati seal after pashupati lord of all animals an epithet of shiva while marshalls work has earned some support many critics and even supporters have raised several objections doris srinivasan has argued that the figure does not have three faces or yogic posture and that in vedic literature rudra was not a protector of wild animals herbert sullivan and alf hiltebeitel also rejected marshalls conclusions with the former claiming that the figure was female while the latter associated the figure with mahisha the buffalo god and the surrounding animals with vahanas vehicles of deities for the four cardinal directions writing in  gregory l possehl concluded that while it would be appropriate to recognise the figure as a deity its association with the water buffalo and its posture as one of ritual discipline regarding it as a protoshiva would be going too far despite the criticisms of marshalls association of the seal with a protoshiva icon it has been interpreted as the tirthankara rishabhanatha by some scholars of jainism like vilas sangave historians such as heinrich zimmer and thomas mcevilley believe that there is a connection between first jain tirthankara rishabhanatha and the indus valley civilisation marshall hypothesised the existence of a cult of mother goddess worship based upon excavation of several female figurines and thought that this was a precursor of the hindu sect of shaktism however the function of the female figurines in the life of indus valley people remains unclear and possehl does not regard the evidence for marshalls hypothesis to be terribly robust some of the baetyls interpreted by marshall to be sacred phallic representations are now thought to have been used as pestles or game counters instead while the ring stones that were thought to symbolise yoni were determined to be architectural features used to stand pillars although the possibility of their religious symbolism cannot be eliminated many indus valley seals show animals with some depicting them being carried in processions while others show chimeric creations one seal from mohenjodaro shows a halfhuman a halfbuffalo monster attacking a tiger which may be a reference to the sumerian myth of such a monster created by goddess aruru to fight gilgamesh in contrast to contemporary egyptian and mesopotamian civilisations indus valley lacks any monumental palaces even though excavated cities indicate that the society possessed the requisite engineering knowledge this may suggest that religious ceremonies if any may have been largely confined to individual homes small temples or the open air several sites have been proposed by marshall and later scholars as possibly devoted to religious purposes but at present only the great bath at mohenjodaro is widely thought to have been so used as a place for ritual purification the funerary practices of the harappan civilisation are marked by fractional burial in which the body is reduced to skeletal remains by exposure to the elements before final interment and even cremation late harappan around  bce signs of a gradual decline began to emerge and by around  bce most of the cities had been abandoned examination of human skeletons from the site of harappa in the s demonstrated that the end of the indus civilisation saw an increase in interpersonal violence and in infectious diseases like leprosy and tuberculosis according to historian upinder singh the general picture presented by the late harappan phase is one of a breakdown of urban networks and an expansion of rural ones during the period of approximately  to  bce multiple regional cultures emerged within the area of the indus civilisation the cemetery h culture was in punjab haryana and western uttar pradesh the jhukar culture was in sindh and the rangpur culture characterised by lustrous red ware pottery was in gujarat other sites associated with the late phase of the harappan culture are pirak in balochistan pakistan and daimabad in maharashtra india the largest late harappan sites are kudwala in cholistan in punjab bet dwarka in gujarat and daimabad in maharashtra which can be considered as urban but they are smaller and few in number compared with the mature harappan cities bet dwarka was fortified and continued to have contacts with the persian gulf region but there was a general decrease of longdistance trade on the other hand the period also saw a diversification of the agricultural base with a diversity of crops and the advent of doublecropping as well as a shift of rural settlement towards the east and the south the pottery of the late harappan period is described as showing some continuity with mature harappan pottery traditions but also distinctive differences many sites continued to be occupied for some centuries although their urban features declined and disappeared formerly typical artifacts such as stone weights and female figurines became rare there are some circular stamp seals with geometric designs but lacking the indus script which characterised the mature phase of the civilisation script is rare and confined to potsherd inscriptions there was also a decline in longdistance trade although the local cultures show new innovations in faience and glass making and carving of stone beads urban amenities such as drains and the public bath were no longer maintained and newer buildings were poorly constructed stone sculptures were deliberately vandalised valuables were sometimes concealed in hoards suggesting unrest and the corpses of animals and even humans were left unburied in the streets and in abandoned buildings during the later half of the nd millennium bce most of the posturban late harappan settlements were abandoned altogether subsequent material culture was typically characterised by temporary occupation the campsites of a population which was nomadic and mainly pastoralist and which used crude handmade pottery however there is greater continuity and overlap between late harappan and subsequent cultural phases at sites in punjab haryana and western uttar pradesh primarily small rural settlements aryan migration in  sir mortimer wheeler proposed that the invasion of an indoeuropean tribe from central asia the aryans caused the decline of the indus civilisation as evidence he cited a group of  skeletons found in various parts of mohenjodaro and passages in the vedas referring to battles and forts however scholars soon started to reject wheelers theory since the skeletons belonged to a period after the citys abandonment and none were found near the citadel subsequent examinations of the skeletons by kenneth kennedy in  showed that the marks on the skulls were caused by erosion and not by violence in the cemetery h culture the late harappan phase in the punjab region some of the designs painted on the funerary urns have been interpreted through the lens of vedic literature for instance peacocks with hollow bodies and a small human form inside which has been interpreted as the souls of the dead and a hound that can be seen as the hound of yama the god of death this may indicate the introduction of new religious beliefs during this period but the archaeological evidence does not support the hypothesis that the cemetery h people were the destroyers of the harappan cities climate change and drought suggested contributory causes for the localisation of the ivc include changes in the course of the river and climate change that is also signalled for the neighbouring areas of the middle east as of  many scholars believe that drought and a decline in trade with egypt and mesopotamia caused the collapse of the indus civilisation the climate change which caused the collapse of the indus valley civilisation was possibly due to an abrupt and critical megadrought and cooling  years ago which marks the onset of the meghalayan age the present stage of the holocene the ghaggarhakra system was rainfed and watersupply depended on the monsoons the indus valley climate grew significantly cooler and drier from about  bce linked to a general weakening of the monsoon at that time the indian monsoon declined and aridity increased with the ghaggarhakra retracting its reach towards the foothills of the himalaya leading to erratic and less extensive floods that made inundation agriculture less sustainable aridification reduced the water supply enough to cause the civilisations demise and scatter its population eastward according to giosan et al  the ivc residents did not develop irrigation capabilities relying mainly on the seasonal monsoons leading to summer floods as the monsoons kept shifting south the floods grew too erratic for sustainable agricultural activities the residents then migrated towards the ganges basin in the east where they established smaller villages and isolated farms the small surplus produced in these small communities did not allow the development of trade and the cities died out continuity and coexistence archaeological excavations indicate that the decline of harappa drove people eastward according to possehl after  bce the number of sites in todays india increased from  to  according to andrew lawler excavations along the gangetic plain show that cities began to arise there starting about  bce just a few centuries after harappa was deserted and much earlier than once suspected according to jim shaffer there was a continuous series of cultural developments just as in most areas of the world these link the socalled two major phases of urbanisation in south asia at sites such as bhagwanpura in haryana archaeological excavations have discovered an overlap between the final phase of late harappan pottery and the earliest phase of painted grey ware pottery the latter being associated with the vedic culture and dating from around  bce this site provides evidence of multiple social groups occupying the same village but using different pottery and living in different types of houses over time the late harappan pottery was gradually replaced by painted grey ware pottery and other cultural changes indicated by archaeology include the introduction of the horse iron tools and new religious practices there is also a harappan site called rojdi in rajkot district of saurashtra its excavation started under an archaeological team from gujarat state department of archaeology and the museum of the university of pennsylvania in  in their report on archaeological excavations at rojdi gregory possehl and mh raval write that although there are obvious signs of cultural continuity between the harappan civilisation and later south asian cultures many aspects of the harappan sociocultural system and integrated civilization were lost forever while the second urbanisation of india beginning with the northern black polished ware culture c  bce lies well outside this sociocultural environment postharappan previously scholars believed that the decline of the harappan civilisation led to an interruption of urban life in the indian subcontinent however the indus valley civilisation did not disappear suddenly and many elements of the indus civilisation appear in later cultures the cemetery h culture may be the manifestation of the late harappan over a large area in the region of punjab haryana and western uttar pradesh and the ochre coloured pottery culture its successor david gordon white cites three other mainstream scholars who have emphatically demonstrated that vedic religion derives partially from the indus valley civilisations as of  archaeological data suggests that the material culture classified as late harappan may have persisted until at least c  bce and was partially contemporaneous with the painted grey ware culture harvard archaeologist richard meadow points to the late harappan settlement of pirak which thrived continuously from  bce to the time of the invasion of alexander the great in  bce in the aftermath of the indus civilisations localisation regional cultures emerged to varying degrees showing the influence of the indus civilisation in the formerly great city of harappa burials have been found that correspond to a regional culture called the cemetery h culture at the same time the ochre coloured pottery culture expanded from rajasthan into the gangetic plain the cemetery h culture has the earliest evidence for cremation a practice dominant in hinduism today the inhabitants of the indus valley civilisation migrated from the river valleys of indus and ghaggarhakra towards the himalayan foothills of the gangayamuna basin genetics in  a study was published by shinde et al on a reconstructed genome obtained from a female skeleton found in an ivcrelated cemetery in rakhigarhi haryana india dating to around  bce the analysis suggested that the majority of the genome was closely related to mesolithic iranian huntergatherers the remaining portion of the genome was from an indigenous east eurasian source termed ancient ancestral south indian aasi thought to represent indigenous south asian huntergatherer ancestry the genome completely lacked the western steppe herderrelated ancestry that is found in modern particularly in northern south asians or any anatolian neolithic farmer ancestry the ancestry of the ivcrelated individual is similar to the majority of the ancestry of modern south asians see also notes references bibliography further reading external links harappa and indus valley civilization at harappacom
